                  <b>Every journey must begin from somewhere!</b> Our first
                  formal competition as iGEM 2025 was in the Techfuse 2025 Event
                  in Ioannina. The event took place from the 13th to the 15th of
                  March. <br />
                  <br />
                  TechFuse covered issues related to ecosystem development,
                  cutting-edge technologies, the evolution of innovation and
                  start-up entrepreneurship, the impact of technology on society
                  and work, the relationship between technology and culture, and
                  broader regional development at the economic and social level.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Its agenda is multi-thematic and includes Greek and
                  international speakers from the fields of politics,
                  entrepreneurship, the research community, society, and
                  culture. The conference included social activities, with a
                  focus on promoting culture in Ioannina and Epirus, and free
                  educational seminars for students and professionals at the
                  beginning of their careers.

                  form of innovative digital products or services, business
                  ideas, and policy proposals, creating a bridge from the future

                  At the end of the workshop, the teams had the opportunity to
                  present the challenge they worked on, their approach, and the
                  solution they implemented. It was an eye-opening experience.

                  interactive sessions were held where we discussed and shaped
                  the first iterations of what Halocrops would become. The work
                  was gruelling with more than 10 hours per day spent in this
                  event. We also met a diverse cast of entrepreneurs of Mantis

              Politicians, Scientists, everyone was there to meet with our
              team's project and its feasible Business Plan. Our team stayed
              there from September 6th, which marked our presentation date for
              our project, till September 14th. This event was{" "}

                a true testimony on how our team's model wasn't only just a

              to even be included into the “Research, Innovation, Technology”
              department of the Exhibition! We also met many interesting

                had to find a good ending in order to finish our
                entrepreneurship idea
              </b>
              . We had to finish with a bang! Something that the next teams can
              look up to and that we could also be able to afford considering
              all the people we have met, different startup ideas also coming
              from our University, professors, mentors, PIs. It was all coming
              to place, and this caused our last project, a full-circle moment,
              the “BIOCATALYST” event.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our team's business department had the honour to get in contact
              once again with Mr. Andreas Klapsi. Mr. Andreas Klapsis, who is a
              business development professional especially regarding the startup
              ecosystem, was the perfect “catalyst” for our "Research and
              Entrepreneurship" building bridge event. Alongside him, we came
              into contact with the Startup Week Greece organisation. An annual
              event happening in the midst of October where cities all around
              Greece hold events under the SWG (Startup Week Greece) auspices.In

                we had the honor of exclusively representing Ioannina inside
                Startup Week Greece

              as the sole event in Ioannina, becoming carriers of innovation in
              our local community!
              <br />
              <br />
              After presenting our idea for Halocrops, and also noting our will
              to under any circumstance hold the biggest Startup event at Epirus
              held by students of the University of Ioannina, we immediately
              took action. We contacted startup businesses, biotech and
              pharmaceutical companies all around our country, university
              professors, startup founders coming from our academia and many
              more. At the end, our event started taking actual form. We
              contacted the Joist Innovation Centre which agreed to co-organise
              this event by sharing its conference hall for our BIOCATALYST
              event. Right at that moment our team made a huge shift, it went
              from just being the participants of those said events, to
              organising one of our own. Promotional activities included,
              creating new posters, a landing page/ startup registration form in
              the “Luma” website, and visits to each university to individually
              interact with students and pitch them our vision.

              . The network that our team managed to build in such a short time
              was just as exciting as our own personal pathways going from pure
              science majors to getting trained on developing our
              entrepreneurial skills, a time which at many parts exhausting
              turned out as our most rewarding experience.
