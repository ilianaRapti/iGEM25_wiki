            Our visit to the <b>Association of the Blind of Ioannina</b> was a step toward making synthetic biology 
            and our project accessible to everyone, regardless of visual ability. By connecting directly with 
            this community, we aimed to <b>remove barriers to scientific engagement</b> and foster equal opportunities 
            for participation and understanding.
        </p>

                We prepared carefully for the visit, creating a <b>clear and descriptive presentation</b> about our 
                iGEM team, our project and our outreach initiatives. Most importantly, we brought <b>two children's 
                books written in Braille</b>. These books were based on stories that explain our project to younger 
                audiences in a fun and accessible way.

                During the visit, we met with the Association’s members and presented our work. The highlight of 
                the meeting was sharing our Braille books. The president of the Association praised them, noting 
                their <b>high quality, accurate printing, and detailed descriptions</b>.
                <br></br><br></br>

                We donated both books to the Association so that they can <b>circulate among visually impaired individuals 
                in the community</b>.<br></br>
                Inspired by this positive reception, we planned further actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Recording a <b>podcast episode</b> with the president to discuss the books, inclusivity, and the importance of equal access to knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Creating a <b>joint social media post</b> to raise awareness and highlight this collaboration.</li>
                </ul>

                The visit was met with enthusiasm. The Association recognized the value of our initiative and 
                committed to helping spread the Braille books to reach more people. This collaboration opened 
                the door to new ways of making synthetic <b>biology inclusive and engaging</b>.<br></br>

                Also, the President of the Union of the Blind praised our work, saying: "The work you have done 
                is outstanding. The image descriptions are flawless, something I rarely encounter. The only 
                thing I would like to see additionally is the names of the author and the person responsible 
                for the illustrations inside the book, so that I can read that as well."

                Science should be for everyone. By providing accessible materials and actively engaging 
                with communities often discriminated, we <b>empower individuals</b> to be part of the 
                conversation about research and environmental issues. This visit demonstrated how 
                inclusivity in science communication builds <b>trust, representation and shared ownership 
                of knowledge</b>.
