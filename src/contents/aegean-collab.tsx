        <p>The Aegean Meeting was designed to <b>strengthen collaboration among iGEM teams</b> in Greece and nearby regions. Over three days in Ioannina, teams gathered to share their projects, exchange feedback, and create lasting connections.</p>
        <p>To make the event accessible to everyone, we used a hybrid format, allowing teams to either attend in person or join online. <b>Thessaloniki</b> and <b>Thessaly</b> were present physically, while <b>Athens</b>, <b>MBG-DuTH</b>, and <b>Patras-Med</b> participated virtually. Although <b>iGEM Patras</b> could not attend this year, they were included in the invitations, showing our commitment to <b>bringing all Greek iGEM teams together</b>. We also extended our network by inviting one team from <b>Turkey, iGEM AEGIS</b>, fostering international collaboration.</p>

          <p><b>Day two</b> was dedicated to science and collaboration.</p>
          <p>At the University of Ioannina, each team presented its current project. Even teams participating virtually were able to fully engage thanks to the hybrid setup. The highlight of the day was when <b>iGEM Ioannina 2024</b> presented their project <b>ATROPOS</b>, which inspired everyone and sparked rich discussions.</p>
          <p>The presence of <b>Ambassador Markos Mathioudakis</b> added further value to the day. He shared insights from his experience and answered questions during an engaging Q&A session. His role as a mentor and collaborator deepened the sense of connection between teams.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon, participants visited Kyra Frosini island, a place full of history and myths. Walking among its iconic plane trees created a cultural connection that tied perfectly to our team's project focus. The day concluded with informal evening conversations indoors, allowing for open dialogue and deeper relationship-building.</p>
