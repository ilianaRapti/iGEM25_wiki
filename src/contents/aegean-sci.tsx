                    <p>The Aegean Meeting was an opportunity for Greek iGEM teams <b>to communicate science clearly and effectively</b>. Over three days, participants presented their projects, shared ideas and practiced conveying complex concepts in a way that was both understandable and engaging.</p>    
                    <p>The event began with an informal evening gathering, setting a friendly atmosphere. On the second day, teams presented their projects at the university, with some participating virtually, while our advisors presented last year’s project, ATROPOS, and shared their experiences from the Jamboree and iGEM in general. The presence of iGEM Ambassador Mr. Markos Mathioudakis added value, as he provided constructive feedback and answered questions about the competition and synthetic biology outreach.</p>

                <p>In addition to presentations, the meeting included social activities such as a trip to the island and group outings. These informal settings allowed participants to practice science communication beyond formal presentations, engaging in casual discussions that strengthened both skills and relationships.</p>
