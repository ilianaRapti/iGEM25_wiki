              <p>The second visit to ELEPAP was carefully organized to build on the knowledge shared during our first visit and ensure active participation from all students from the adults department. Before presenting our project in detail, we started with a short questionnaire to gauge what the students remembered, which helped us adapt the session to their level of understanding.</p>
              <p>The questionnaire included questions on identifying the plane tree, recalling biology-related concepts and distinguishing between healthy and diseased trees. This allowed students to engage directly with the content and reinforced their learning from the first visit.</p>
              <p>We engaged students in discussions on DNA and synthetic biology using simple analogies, followed by the fairytale “The Forest of Dreams” and a playful dance activity. Guided by specialists, all activities were tailored to ensure an inclusive, enjoyable, and accessible experience for every student.</p>

                The visits to ELEPAP’s Adults Department were highly successful, promoting engagement, learning and inclusivity. Students recalled key concepts, actively participated in discussions on DNA and synthetic biology and demonstrated curiosity. Feedback from participants and staff highlighted that the sessions were enjoyable and meaningful. By combining quizzes, discussions, storytelling and playful activities, the program made science accessible and fun, ensuring that every participant could learn, engage and feel valued.
                <br />
                At the same time, we can also conclude from the results of the questionnaire, presented below, that most students answered all three questions correctly, confirming that the presentation during our first visit was easily understood and appropriately tailored.
