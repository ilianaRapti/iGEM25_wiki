            Education should be interactive, engaging, and accessible to young learners.
            Our full-day immersion at the Department of Biological Applications and Technology allowed 
            junior high students to explore synthetic biology through playful demonstrations, hands-on 
            experiments, and real laboratory experiences.

            The program was carefully structured to combine clear explanations, 
            interactive exercises, and lab rotations. 
            LEGO-based activities were designed to illustrate genetic engineering intuitively, 
            showing how genes can be “knocked in” to alter an organism’s behavior. We also 
            included organic chemistry and microbiology lab experiences to provide students 
            with real experimental practice, along with a final awards ceremony to celebrate 
            creativity and understanding.

            We began by welcoming the thirty students and explaining synthetic biology 
            in everyday language. Using vivid analogies, we likened genes to LEGO bricks,
            demonstrating how iGEM teams use similar principles in real research. Playful demonstrations
            allowed students to explore gene manipulation, while Q&A sessions connected these concepts to
            bioethical considerations and real-world applications.
            <br></br><br></br>

            Students then worked in pairs to design solutions using synthetic-biology
            principles. Later, lab rotations provided hands-on experiences:
            <ul>
              <li>In the <b>organic chemistry lab</b>, students performed “magic surgery”
                using potassium thiocyanate, explored liquid nitrogen experiments 
                (shattering a rose, creating clouds), and conducted the “Elephant’s
                Toothpaste” foam reaction.
                </li>
              <li>In the <b>microbiology lab</b>, they practiced aseptic techniques, streaked agar plates, and observed live microorganisms under microscopes.</li>
            </ul>
            The day concluded with an awards ceremony, where pairs were 
            evaluated on fun, creativity, scientific plausibility, and clarity. 
            The top five teams received commemorative candles engraved with a plane 
            tree, symbolizing knowledge, endurance, and the heart of our project.

                Students developed a clear understanding of synthetic biology and
                its practical applications. Hands-on activities sparked excitement
                and curiosity, while the awards encouraged engagement and recognition
                of achievement.

                Interactive STEM education connects theory to practice, encourages 
                creativity, and inspires young learners to explore scientific fields. 
                It demonstrates that complex scientific concepts can be accessible, 
                memorable, and fun.
