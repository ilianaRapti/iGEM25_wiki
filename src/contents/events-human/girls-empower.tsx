              <p>On June 18th, our team had the opportunity to participate in a special event organized by the <b>preparatory English school The English Workshop</b> by Alexandra Bitza. The event was a <b>Girls-Empowerment event</b>, held at Epirus Palace Hotel in Ioannina, was titled <b>“Women in History Afternoon Tea”</b>. Its aim was to highlight and celebrate the lives and contributions of women throughout history, inspiring children to recognize their importance in shaping the world. For us, this was not only an opportunity to present our project but also to underline the inclusivity and equality we stand for as a team, particularly regarding women’s often-overlooked contributions in science.</p>

              <p>The event was carefully designed by the school to be both educational and inspiring. Each student selected a historical female figure they admired, dressed up as her and prepared a presentation and a short theatrical sketch to bring her story to life. Alongside this program, our team was invited by the school’s owner to enrich the event with a scientific perspective, linking the theme of women in history to women in science today. Our task was to showcase iGEM, our team’s identity, and this year’s project while also sharing our research results from one of our previous actions on International Day of Women and Girls in Science.</p>

              <p>During the event, we began by explaining what iGEM is and how our team works collaboratively across disciplines. We then introduced our current project, making it accessible to a younger audience. Finally, we presented the findings of our survey from the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, sparking an engaging discussion. Students, parents, and teachers asked thoughtful questions, showing real interest in our work.</p>

              <p>The action succeeded in promoting inclusivity by directly addressing the gender gap in science. The children not only celebrated women from the past but also engaged with contemporary issues, seeing firsthand how women continue to shape the field of research. Our presence connected the historical figures they studied with real-world examples of women’s current and future contributions in STEM. The positive interaction and curiosity of the audience reflected the impact of our message: that equality in science is both necessary and achievable.</p>

              <p>Inclusivity in education and science is vital because women’s achievements are too often underrepresented. Events like this encourage children—both girls and boys—to appreciate the value of equality and diversity, something necessary for our future leaders, scientists and, above all, global citizens. By linking the past with the present, we reinforced the idea that inclusivity is not just about recognizing achievements retrospectively, but also about creating opportunities for the future. Children, especially young girls, need to understand that their voices and opinions matter. For us, this was a chance to affirm that science belongs to everyone, regardless of gender, age or sexuality. </p>

              <p>For our team, this action was deeply rewarding. We gained the experience of communicating science to a diverse audience, adapting our presentation to be engaging for children while also meaningful for adults. We also strengthened our role as advocates for equality in STEM, empowering girls and young women to pursue a career in science and be like their historical role models, which is at the heart of our values as a team. </p>
