              <p>As part of our inclusivity and outreach activities, our team organized a one-day student event with the title “Think Different, Learn Together” at the Academia of Ioannina. The central aim of this event was to present biology and science as inclusive spaces where every student can actively participate, engage, and feel represented. We wanted to show that science is for everyone—regardless of background, learning style, or physical ability.</p>

              <p>We invited five high schools from Ioannina, with 90 students attending in total. Among them, 15 students were from ELEPAP (Rehabilitation for the Disabled, a non-profit charity organization in Greece). This was a vital step for us, since we wanted to make sure that all students, including those who do not always have access to such scientific experiences, could take part. The event was carefully designed with short sessions, breaks, and interactive content to make it accessible, ADHD-friendly, and inclusive to diverse learning needs.</p>

              <p>The conference opened with welcoming presentations about who we are and our project. It then moved into lectures: Dr. Michaelidis (professor of Molecular Genetics, University of Ioannina) introduced synthetic biology, while a member of iGEM IOANNINA 2024 shared insights on collaboration and inclusion with her presentation <b>“All in science: The role of collaboration and inclusion”</b>.</p>
              <p>During the big break, we held several activities in the hall: original science-themed board games, video games and activity books, a career guidance bench where students could talk with our team members from different university departments, and mini workshops with microscopes, stereoscopes, and microbiology exercises using safe, everyday materials (pineapple jello instead of agar and food coloring instead of microorganisms just so they could practice basic microbiology techniques). These activities ensured that students of different abilities and interests could find something they felt comfortable and excited to engage with. </p>
              <p>After the break, we held an interactive “Myth or Truth” game, which kept all students engaged by allowing them to answer questions in simple, direct ways—through raising hands or short replies. The conference closed with a live science showtime, where students were invited on stage as volunteers.</p>

              <p>Students of all backgrounds actively participated and fully engaged in the workshops and games. The “Myth or Truth” session demonstrated that they retained key scientific concepts and felt confident enough to respond. For many students, this was their first time handling scientific instruments, engaging with university students, and experiencing a professional science conference in such an approachable way. Teachers shared that they were impressed by how much the students enjoyed the event and by how included they felt in the process. They even expressed their interest in inviting us at their school to make a presentation to the rest of the school community as well, as they felt like the problem we are focusing on should be known by everyone at Ioannina. One of them proposed we do a one-day event at their school too. </p>

              <p>Creating inclusive spaces in science is vital, especially in Greece where opportunities for hands-on scientific learning are often limited in public schools. By adapting the format with humor, music, simple language, frequent breaks, and interactive design, we made science approachable to students who may have different learning needs. Including ELEPAP was particularly significant, as it showed that science events can—and should—welcome students with disabilities. This inclusivity fosters a sense of belonging and encourages students to see themselves as future scientists, regardless of barriers. As the title of our event states, we may think differently, but we can learn all together.</p>

              <p>Through this action, we gained valuable experience in designing inclusive educational content. We learned how to adapt complex scientific topics into accessible and engaging formats and how to create an environment where every student could participate equally. As a team, we were reminded of the importance of empathy, adaptability, and creativity in science communication. This event strengthened our belief that inclusivity is not just an add-on, but a fundamental part of education and science.</p>
