              <p>In Vitsa, a UNESCO-protected village in Zagori, we carried out an educational outreach event with children aged 6–12, organized in collaboration with the local KDAP RODA (“After School Creative Activities Center”) center and an ecology professor at the University of Ioannina, Dr. Stara. The aim of the activity was to introduce kids to biology and more specifically to synthetic biology and the importance of plane trees in a way that was fun, age-appropriate and engaging. By combining interactive narration, games and hands-on creative activities, we designed an event that expanded science education outside the classroom and into the heart of the community.</p>

              <p>Together with the KDAP center, we developed materials that <b>made scientific concepts understandable and memorable</b> for young learners. In particular, we created:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A fairytale (The Girl and the Plane Tree) that introduced DNA as “building blocks of life.”</li>
                <li>Crossword puzzles, matching games and word searches to reinforce scientific vocabulary.</li>
                <li>A drawing corner where attendees could reflect creatively on what they learned.</li>
                <li>A collaborative activity, the “Tree of Memories,” where kids wrote wishes for the plane trees on paper leaves, combining environmental education with personal expression. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>This thoughtful preparation ensured that learning opportunities were embedded into every part of the event.</p>

              <p>The event began with the reading of our fairytale, which triggered immediate curiosity. One child connected the “blocks of life” in the story with DNA parts, demonstrating how storytelling can foster scientific understanding. Other children asked about tree diseases, fungal transmission and how to prevent infections. We explained these topics in simple language, emphasizing practical lessons such as the importance of clean tools when pruning plane trees.</p>
              <p>The educational impact extended beyond direct science. Particularly, through the “Tree of Memories” activity, learners expressed gratitude to trees (“thank you for oxygen”) and wished for their recovery. This combined factual learning with emotional engagement, reinforcing the importance of trees in ecosystems and communities.</p>
              <p>Parents and other adults also joined the activities, listening to explanations and asking questions themselves. Some even expressed willingness to help us with our documentary, PLÁTANOS, showing that the educational value reached beyond kids to the wider community.</p>

              <p>This event showed the importance of <b>interactive science education</b>. By adapting complex concepts into simple stories, puzzles and pracrical activities and we proved that even young children can engage meaningfully with biology. It also highlighted the value of connecting science to the natural environment around the learners—in this case, the plane trees central to Vitsa’s identity and heritage.</p>
              <p>Educational outreach of this kind plants the seeds of curiosity early, encourages critical questions and helps young people see the relevance of science in their daily lives.</p>

              <p>We learned how to <b>design and deliver science education across different ages</b> and levels of understanding. The learners’ questions reminded us of the value of curiosity and how scientific ideas can be translated into simple, engaging formats. We also saw how involving parents and educators strengthens the educational impact, turning a children’s activity into a whole-community experience.</p>
              <p>Also, while younger attendees connected most strongly with drawing and interactive narration, we realized that children over ten, needed more intellectually stimulating activities. From this realization, we developed the idea of an educational board game tailored for older attendees. Combining elements of taboo, charades and quiz-style questions, the game introduces synthetic biology and the challenges facing plane trees in a playful but thought-provoking way. Through this tool, older participants are not only entertained, but actively practice problem-solving, knowledge recall and scientific reasoning—bridging fun with meaningful learning.</p>
              <p>For us, the Vitsa event was a <b>powerful reminder that science education is most effective when it is playful, interactive and rooted in the local context of learners.</b></p>
