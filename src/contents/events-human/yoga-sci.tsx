                At Its Kale in Ioannina, our team hosted a unique event 
                that combined <b>yoga, sound therapy</b>, and <b>drawing</b> with <b>science 
                communication</b>. While the gathering offered participants a moment 
                of calm, its deeper purpose was to create an inclusive environment 
                where scientific ideas could be shared in creative and accessible 
                ways. This approach exemplified our commitment to making synthetic 
                biology relevant to local contexts and everyday experiences.

            The event was designed to reach both students and community members,
            ensuring that the conversation extended beyond academic circles. 
            With the support of yoga and sound therapist Dioni Sarantinou, 
            we created a welcoming atmosphere that <b>blended well-being practices
            with scientific dialogue</b>. This <b>interdisciplinary</b> format invited participation
            from people who may not usually attend science-oriented activities, 
            highlighting the potential of cultural spaces as venues for outreach.

            <b>Science communication</b> was woven into the program at key moments. 
            Between yoga and sound therapy sessions, we introduced our iGEM 
            project on canker stain disease in plane trees. By explaining both 
            the environmental impact of this disease and the ways synthetic 
            biology can provide sustainable solutions, we emphasized the project’s 
            relevance to the local community. The drawing exercise further 
            deepened engagement by encouraging participants to reflect on trees 
            <b>not only as ecological entities</b> but also <b>as personal symbols</b>—connecting
            scientific knowledge to individual experience.
            <br></br><br></br>

            The outcomes underscored the effectiveness of this <b>inclusive model</b>. Students reported
            gaining a clearer understanding of <b>iGEM’s purpose</b> and recognized how synthetic biology 
            could be applied to address regional challenges. Several attendees expressed interest in 
            joining future iGEM teams, confirming the event’s potential to inspire the next generation of 
            participants. By offering multiple modes of engagement—movement, sound, drawing, and discussion—
            we ensured that everyone could participate in ways that suited them.
