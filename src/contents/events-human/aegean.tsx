                        <p>The Aegean Meeting was conceived as an opportunity to bring together iGEM teams from across Greece, fostering a sense of unity and inclusivity. By hosting this three-day event in Ioannina, we aimed to create a welcoming environment where teams could connect, share their projects and form meaningful relationships beyond the competition itself.</p>

                        <p>We designed a program that <b>balanced scientific exchange and social interaction</b>. Given the busy schedules of some teams, we adopted a <b>hybrid format</b>, allowing teams to join either in person or virtually through a video call. We also reached out to last year's iGEM Ioannina team and invited them to present their project from 2024, <b>ATROPOS</b>.To enhance the experience, we invited <b>iGEM Ambassador Mr. Markos Mathioudakis</b>, who provided valuable insights and answered questions during a live Q&A session.</p>

                        <p><b>On Day 1</b>, participants arrived in Ioannina and gathered for an evening social outing, setting a friendly tone for the weekend.</p>
                        <p><b>On Day 2</b>, we began with project presentations at the university. Each team introduced their work, while teams unable to attend in person joined via video call. Additionally, our advisors presented last year's team project, ATROPOS, and then shared their experiences from the Jamboree with us. After the presentations, Ambassador Mathioudakis led a discussion on the challenges and opportunities of the competition.
                            In the afternoon, we planned a group excursion to the local island, offering a chance to relax and bond. A sudden storm altered our plans, leading to a cozy evening indoors, where teams continued to connect informally.</p>
                        <p><b>On Day 3</b>, we concluded with a morning coffee and a farewell walk before participants departed.
