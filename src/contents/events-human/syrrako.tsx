              <p>On August 7th, our team visited a village in the mountain of Epirus, Syrrako, to present our project and interact with the locals. For us, this was not only about science communication but also about inclusivity. Our goal was to bring our project to people who usually do not have access to such scientific discussions because of their remote location and to share our work with all age groups, from children to the elderly. What made it even more interesting was that Syrrako’s trees had been struck by the Canker Stain disease, they were cut and replaced by two hybrid plane trees, something that according to the locals, did not fill the emotional void caused by the death of their iconic plane trees. </p>

              <p>Firstly, we contacted the president of the village, Giorgos Vaitsis, and organized our visit in detail. During our team meetings, we focused on how to make the content inclusive for a broad audience. We prepared a presentation appropriate for communicating effectively across different age groups and levels of scientific knowledge and we brought our fairytales, activity books and puzzle to involve children too. We made the presentation clear and planned to explain everything friendly and in simple terms. Lastly, we prepared some possible questions that we could ask the villagers. This careful planning allowed us to ensure that everyone could feel part of the discussion. At the end, we gave a questionnaire to assess both the clarity of the presentation and the residents’ views on the value of plane trees.</p>

We then held our presentation at the conference center of Syrrako and at its end we started an open group discussion with the audience. Lastly, we walked around the village and interacted with the locals to get to know each other even more. We were pleased that they opened up to us, sharing their views on the challenges of their plane trees as well as their personal stories with the trees and their favorite traditions involving the trees. All these stories were filmed and added to our short documentary <b>“PLÀTANOS”</b>. By documenting these testimonies, we extended the inclusivity of the action further, giving a voice to local people and allowing their stories to reach a broader audience. Importantly, our choice to travel to Syrrako—a remote village not often reached by scientific teams—ensured that this community had the opportunity to access and contribute to the conversation. </p>

Eventually, everyone participated meaningfully. </p>

Guided by the motto <b>“Local people solving local problems”</b>, we joined the people of Syrrako who wanted their trees to be saved. The experience reinforced our belief that reaching remote communities, listening to their perspectives and giving space to their voices is as important as the science itself. This action taught us that inclusivity enriches not only the community but also the scientific process.</p>

          Purpose: to <b>share our project inclusively</b>, especially since remote areas rarely get science presentations and discussions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The village’s iconic <b>plane trees died from Canker Stain</b> and they were replaced by hybrids, causing disappointment to the locals.

        <li>Prepared a simple and clear presentation inclusive for all ages and profiles.</li>
        <li>Wrote down possible questions we could ask the villagers.</li>
        <li>
          Goal: to make everyone feel part of the discussion.

        <li>Locals shared <b>stories about plane trees + traditions</b>.</li>
        <li>Stories were <b>filmed for our documentary</b> → giving locals a voice.</li>
        <li>
          Importance: bringing science to a <b>remote, usually overlooked community</b>.

      </ul>

      <p><b>Outcomes and Results</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Villagers shared personal emotional stories.</li>
        <li>Showed <b>deep cultural ties</b> to plane trees.</li>
        <li>The agronomist gave <b>professional feedback</b>.</li>
        <li>Locals asked <b>curious, relevant questions</b>.</li>
        <li>Everyone <b>got involved meaningfully</b>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Why This Matters</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>This action made science <b>reachable for all ages</b> → bridged <b>generational gaps</b>.</li>
        <li>We made science accessible to a remote location.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>What Did We Gain</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saw the <b>emotional + cultural value</b> of the trees.</li>
        <li>Felt more <b>motivated + needed</b>.</li>
