                Each week our social media team prepared five posts for Instagram, 
                Facebook and LinkedIn - one for each of the following columns - that delivered 
                short, understandable and engaging lessons in biology. It is true that we live 
                in a society where social media have a huge impact on everyone and they can be 
                highly useful in transmitting knowledge.

                from the variety of the chemistry of tears to why we get chills when listening to 
                music. Adding elements such as references to tv shows, music and pretty graphics 
                made the posts more likeable and friendly to social media users, by catching their 
                attention.

                        malfunctions, and a fun fact. It’s science made engaging as part of 
                        our digital science communication perspective, blending creativity with 
                        biology to show how tiny molecular players have a huge impact on our

                        scientific contributions.

                Our weekly scientific columns were designed with inclusivity at their core. 
                By creating four recurring themes we aimed to make science approachable for 
                everyone, regardless of age, background, or prior knowledge. The posts combined 
                bright visuals, simple language, and clear explanations, ensuring that even 
                complex biological concepts became accessible and enjoyable. Posting on different 
                platforms allowed us to reach out to different groups of people 
                (different age or academic backgrounds). Through this initiative, we created 
                a space where people who might not typically engage with science could feel 
                welcomed, included, and inspired to learn more about the natural world.
