              <p>By reconnecting with nature, we emphasized the importance of protecting it—particularly the plane trees threatened by <b>canker stain disease</b>.</p>

              <p>We strengthened our presence within the community, inspired university students, and learned how to <b>share science</b> in more <b>accessible ways</b>. The event showed that protecting <b>nature</b>, <b>supporting well-being</b>, and <b>advancing science</b> are interconnected goals that can be communicated together.</p>
              <p>For our team, this event was more than <b>outreach</b>—it was a valuable learning experience. We gained practical skills in <b>communicating complex scientific concepts</b> in ways that are accessible and engaging to diverse audiences, and we learned to design inclusive activities that combine creativity, movement, and sound with science. We also realized that inclusivity goes beyond access to information: it means creating spaces where everyone can participate meaningfully, regardless of age or ability. Additionally, the event strengthened our teamwork and adaptability, while fostering stronger connections with the community and inspiring local students to engage with our <b>iGEM project</b>.</p>
