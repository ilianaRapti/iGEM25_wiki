            <p>
            On <b>International Women’s Day</b>, our team organized a three-part initiative 
            designed to bring <b>gender equality</b> in science into everyday campus spaces. 
            The project consisted of an <b>online questionnaire</b>, an interactive stand outside 
            the cafeteria, and a series of short interviews recorded at the Lake of Ioannina.
            Each activity provided a different platform for dialogue, but together they formed 
            a coherent effort to transform abstract reports on gender imbalance into lived, 
            local experiences.

            <p>
            The anonymous questionnaire, distributed via academic email, gathered over <b>500 
            responses</b>. The results revealed both optimism and tension: while <b>88%</b> of participants 
            identified female role models, <b>45%</b> believed that women still lacked equal career 
            opportunities. This contradiction mirrors international data such as She Figures 2021 
            and UNESCO’s Cracking the Code (2017), suggesting that progress in representation does 
            not yet guarantee equity in career advancement.

            Our stand outside the cafeteria created a more personal setting. Around <b>70 
            students</b> engaged with questions on stereotypes, barriers, and support systems. 
            Their responses frequently highlighted themes of underestimation, lack of mentoring, 
            and the persistence of gendered expectations—patterns echoed in global analyses such 
            as UN Women’s 2022 reports. Importantly, the setting turned an ordinary university 
            location into a site of reflection, showing that <b>science communication can thrive beyond 
            lecture halls</b>.

            The final element—video interviews at the Lake of Ioannina—extended the 
            project’s reach far beyond campus. Students shared spontaneous reflections 
            on gender in science, which were edited into a short film that attracted 
            more than <b>20,000 views online</b>. The reach confirmed that authentic stories 
            often resonate more strongly than statistics, capturing attention and sparking 
            conversation.

            Taken together, these three activities provided a 
            layered picture: progress exists, but structural and 
            cultural barriers remain. Just as importantly, the 
            initiative normalized discussions on gender equality in 
            places where silence often dominates. By translating 
            institutional data into <b>peer-to-peer storytelling</b>, we 
            demonstrated that <b>science communication is not only about 
            conveying knowledge but also about creating spaces for 
            dialogue, empowerment, and awareness</b>. In doing so, we 
            contributed to a broader understanding of how inclusive 
            practices enrich the scientific community, both locally and 
            globally.

                <ul>
                <li>Survey sent by email (500+ responses)</li>
                <li>Stand outside cafeteria with interactive questions (70 answers)</li>
                <li>Video interviews at Lake Ioannina, later shared online (20,000+ views)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Students talked about gender equality in science—both progress and gaps</li>

            <p><b>Why It Matters</b></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Women in STEM still face barriers (She Figures 2021, UNESCO 2017)</li>
            <li>Students’ voices highlight these issues in a local context</li>
