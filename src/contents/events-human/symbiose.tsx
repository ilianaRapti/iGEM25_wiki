              <p>Our participation in <b>SymBioSE 2025 in Latvia</b> was an important step in our mission to promote inclusivity within the scientific community. This international event brought together students and researchers from across Europe, most of whom were <b>postgraduates or PhD candidates</b>. By attending, we aimed not only to share our project but also to <b>connect different scientific backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives</b> within synthetic biology.</p>
              <p>The conference provided a unique environment for exchanging knowledge, building relationships, and fostering a sense of belonging among participants at various stages of their academic journeys.</p>

              <p>To maximize our impact at SymBioSE, we prepared <b>two main</b> activities.</p>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>The first was <b>a formal presentation</b> of our project, focusing on the mechanism behind our approach. This presentation was designed to be accessible to a broad audience, balancing scientific depth with clarity.</li>
                <li>The second was a <b>hands-on Benchling workshop</b>. Our goal was to provide attendees with practical skills while promoting active participation and collaboration. Each participant had access to a laptop and worked step-by-step on solving a biological problem using Benchling.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Additionally, we created <b>two feedback forms</b> — one for each activity. These helped us evaluate participants’ understanding and identify ways to improve future presentations and workshops.</p>

              <p><b>Our project presentation</b> received significant attention and enthusiasm.</p>
              <p>One of our team members delivered the talk, which was met with numerous questions and discussions from participants. The feedback form revealed that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>89.2%</b> correctly identified our target fungus (Ceratocystis platani).</li>
                <li><b>73%</b> understood how our system was regulated.</li>
                <li><b>51%</b> rated the presentation as highly insightful (score 5).</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The quality of our talk was further recognized when we were awarded the <b>Best Undergraduate Presentation Award</b>, a testament to our efforts in making our work accessible and engaging to a mixed audience of undergraduate and postgraduate students.</p>
              <p>The <b>Benchling workshop</b> was equally successful.</p>
              <p>Participants were introduced to the platform and then challenged to apply what they had learned to solve a molecular biology task. Feedback showed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Most participants rated the difficulty between <b>3 and 4</b>, suggesting it was appropriately challenging.</li>
                <li>40% found the workshop very useful, while another 40% rated it as useful.</li>
                <li>Many participants reported increased confidence in using Benchling, with some expressing an interest in participating in iGEM in the future.</li>
              </ul>
              Both sessions generated lively discussions, with many attendees approaching us afterward to ask for additional resources and details about our project.
