        <p>
            Visiting Ioannina’s lake to study the dying plane trees offered a 
            clear example of how science communication bridges biology and society. 
            Specifically, we witnessed the process of necrosis of 4 plane trees 
            that were attacked by the fungus Ceratocystis Platani, and they were 
            due to be cut one month later. This is what has to be done to plane 
            trees with the Canker Stain disease according to local authorities. 
            Our goal was to explain and understand from a new perspective both 
            the science behind the aforementioned disease and its significance 
            for the local community.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            We <b>collaborated with municipal representatives and workers</b>, who 
            shared knowledge about the pathogen, current known mitigation 
            strategies, and visible impacts. Our team documented their explanations 
            and asked questions, while we offered our view on how this disease 
            is attacking the plane trees system from a biology focused perspective 
            and on how our solution is both viable and safe for our ecosystem. 
            This material helped extend scientific awareness and communication 
            beyond experts and policymakers.

           Through on-site observation and discussions, we held a dialogue on these key points:
           <br></br><br></br>

           <ul>
            <li><b>The pathogen</b>: <i>Ceratocystis platani</i> infects the vascular system of plane trees, blocking water transport.</li>
            <li><b>Symptoms</b>: Discoloration, wilting, and an unusual “watermelon” smell in infected wood.</li>
           <li><b>Treatment</b>: Infected trees are chemically treated and removed to prevent further spread.</li>
           <li><b>Spread</b>: The disease moves quickly, forcing removal of nearby healthy trees.</li>
           </ul>

           Besides listening to the experts there, we focused on presenting our data as well, in everyday language, maintaining scientific accuracy while making the information understandable.

            Through this action, we once more demonstrated that science 
            is not abstract, but part of everyday life, solving local p
            roblems by providing local solutions. We connected with 
            local authorities, exchanged views and ideas and we became 
            more connected with the local community. Seeing the 
            catastrophic effects of the disease on the trees, we 
            deeply understood why our work is needed and felt
            motivated to continue.

    <p><b>What Happened</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visited Ioannina’s lake to investigate the decline of plane trees caused by Canker Stain Disease (<i>Ceratocystis platani</i>).</li>
      <li>Collaborated with municipal workers and officials to understand the pathogen’s biology, visible effects, and mitigation strategies.</li>
      <li>Documented symptoms, current treatments, and social impact, translating scientific details into clear messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Why It Matters</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gained a broader and clearer message that this disease hinders our city’s ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Connected our academic team with public representatives and labour workers and engaged on the impact of scientific cures behind visible changes in our environment.</li>
      <li>Highlighted how ecosystems and human communities are interlinked.</li>
      <li>Demonstrated that science explains real-life changes that people can see, smell, and feel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Impact</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Local members gained understanding of why and how the plane trees are dying.</li>
      <li>Science communication between university students and Ioannina citizens turned prolonged awareness into action.</li>
      <li>Provided experience for our team members on how the current solutions are insufficient to stop or minimize the disease for Ioannina’s plane trees.</li>
    </ul>
