        <p>
            This action was one of <b>the most meaningful and sensitive 
            inclusivity-focused actions</b> our team has undertaken. 
            We connected with the <b>Second Chance School</b> operating inside <b>Correctional Facility in Nigrita , Serres, Greece</b>, aiming to introduce synthetic biology and 
            environmental awareness to a group of people who rarely have access 
            to scientific education or outreach activities.
            <br></br><br></br>

            From the very beginning, we understood the delicate nature of 
            this initiative. Before proceeding, we first contacted the 
            <b>iGEM Headquarters</b> to ensure that such an action was allowed 
            under competition guidelines and to receive guidance on how to 
            conduct it appropriately.Since we also got approval by the University's board, we worked 
            closely with the prison’s educational staff to design a session 
            that would be <b>safe, respectful and meaningful</b> to the participants.
            <br></br><br></br>

            Our goal was not just to present information, but to <b>create a space for 
            dialogue</b>, where participants could engage actively and feel that their 
            voices and experiences mattered. This approach aligned perfectly with 
            the annual theme of the prison’s educational program, which was <b>climate 
            change</b>. By connecting our project, which focuses on protecting plane 
            trees from a devastating fungal pathogen, to their ongoing studies, we 
            were able to create a discussion that felt relevant and personal to them.

           Planning this session required careful preparation and collaboration.
            Together with the prison staff, we discussed the most appropriate 
            way to approach the students, taking into account their context 
            and needs.
            <br></br><br></br>

            We developed a clear and simple presentation that introduced the 
            basics of synthetic biology, explained the environmental issue we 
            are addressing through our project, and showed how science can 
            play a role in protecting ecosystems. Since this was a sensitive 
            setting, privacy was a top priority. During the video call, we were 
            only able to see the teacher leading the group, while the students 
            remained unseen. This setup helped them feel more comfortable and 
            encouraged open participation without fear of exposure.
            <br></br><br></br>

            The structure of the session was designed to be <b>interactive rather 
            than one-sided</b>. After introducing synthetic biology and our project,
            we encouraged participants to share their own experiences with 
            nature, local ecosystems and environmental changes they have 
            observed. This not only helped us understand their perspectives 
            but also made them active contributors to the conversation.

            <br></br><br></br>
            To evaluate the impact of the session, we created two feedback 
            forms: one for the students and another one for the teachers. 
            These forms gave us valuable insights into how the session was 
            received and how we could improve future outreach activities.

            The session began with a warm introduction to synthetic biology, 
            using everyday language and relatable examples to make the topic 
            accessible. We then presented our project, explaining how our 
            work aims to combat the spread of Ceratocystis platani, a fungus 
            that threatens plane trees.
            <br></br><br></br>
            As the conversation progressed, we connected our project to 
            the participants’ studies on climate change. This created a 
            natural bridge between their existing knowledge and the new 
            concepts we introduced. The students were invited to share 
            their views and experiences, leading to a lively and open 
            discussion.

            Throughout the call, the participants were actively engaged, 
            asking questions and making connections between the science we 
            presented and their own lives. This two-way exchange transformed 
            the session into a <b>collaborative learning experience</b>, rather than 
            a traditional lecture. It also helped break down barriers, showing 
            that scientific knowledge is not only for those in academic 
            institutions but can be shared and understood by everyone, 
            regardless of their life circumstances.

              The feedback was extremely positive.
                <br></br><br></br>

                All participants rated the session <b>5 out of 5</b> in every category,
                including organization, clarity and collaboration. 
                Students described the session as highly interactive and 
                interesting, noting that it helped them understand the 
                importance of protecting the environment.
                <br></br><br></br>

                One student commented that the session “showed how scientific 
                research is directly connected to everyday life and 
                environmental protection.”
                <br></br><br></br>

                The teachers also gave enthusiastic feedback. They found the 
                session to be both educational and pedagogically valuable. 
                They observed that the clarity and approachable tone of our 
                presentation encouraged the students to participate actively, 
                inducing excitement and genuine curiosity.
                <br></br><br></br>

                An unexpected and heartwarming outcome was when the teachers 
                shared photos of an <b>educational board game</b> the students had 
                created about environmental issues. This was a clear sign of 
                how motivated and inspired the students were to continue 
                exploring these topics even after our session ended.

               This initiative demonstrated what true inclusivity means in 
               Scientific outreach. It wasn’t simply about teaching synthetic 
               biology — it was about listening, connecting and empowering a 
               group of individuals who are often left out of scientific 
               conversations. By bringing our project into a prison setting, 
               we expanded access to scientific knowledge and encouraged 
               participants to see themselves as part of the dialogue about 
               environmental protection. This action bridged the gap between 
               science and society, highlighting how scientific education can 
               reach beyond classrooms and laboratories to make a real 
               difference in people’s lives.

            For our team, this experience was deeply transformative. 
            We learned how to <b>communicate complex topics</b> with sensitivity 
            and clarity, ensuring that everyone could follow and engage 
            with the discussion. More importantly, we discovered the value 
            of creating a genuine dialogue. Inclusivity is not just about 
            delivering information but also about <b>listening to different 
            voices</b> and acknowledging the diverse ways people connect with 
            science. This session reinforced our belief that science is 
            for everyone — and that even in settings where access is limited, 
            meaningful conversations can create lasting impact and open new 
            pathways for learning and collaboration.
