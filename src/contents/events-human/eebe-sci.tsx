              <p>Beyond sharing our project’s technical details, we expressed what it truly means to be part of the iGEM competition—the excitement, the challenges, and the lessons learned. By openly describing our journey, we were able to relate to the audience and highlight the value of participating in such an innovative and collaborative competition. Most importantly, we encouraged students in the audience to consider joining iGEM in the future, showing them how this experience can <b>empower young scientists to connect, grow, and make a meaningful impact.</b></p>
