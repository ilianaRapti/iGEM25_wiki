            At SymBioSE 2025, our goal was to make synthetic biology understandable to an 
            international audience. The conference gathered graduate students and researchers 
            from across Europe, many of whom were unfamiliar with plant diseases like canker 
            stain or the tools we use in our research.

            Our presentation focused on storytelling through science communication. 
            We introduced the ecological threat of <i>Ceratocystis platani</i> and explained 
            our project using clear, straightforward language supported by visuals. 
            Complex mechanisms were broken down into digestible steps so that everyone, 
            regardless of background, could follow along.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            The second part of our participation was a hands-on workshop using Benchling. 
            Participants designed plasmids and solved realistic lab problems. While they 
            practiced, we explained each step in context, showing how communication enhances 
            learning by linking theory to action.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            
            This dual approach — presentation and interactive workshop — fostered dialogue, 
            questions and collaboration. Participants left not only with new skills but also with 
            the ability to share what they learned with others, creating a ripple effect of 
            knowledge across Europe.
