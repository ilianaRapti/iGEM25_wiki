                        <p>Our participation in the <b>Thessaloniki International Fair (ΔΕΘ)</b> allowed us to bring <b>synthetic biology directly to the public</b>, transforming complex scientific ideas into something tangible and exciting.</p>
                        <p>Each day, we spent long hours at our booth, welcoming a diverse stream of visitors. We explained our project using <b>simple language and visual aids</b>, showing how our work connects to real-world environmental challenges. The highlight of our booth was our <b>handmade crocheted plane tree mascot</b>, which sparked curiosity and drew people in, especially children and families.</p>

                        <p>To make the experience even more engaging, we provided <b>flyers</b> with detailed information about our project and <b>stickers</b> as a fun takeaway. These small items acted as reminders of their visit and extended our outreach beyond the fair itself.</p>
                        <p>Our audience included <b>professors and researchers</b> interested in the scientific aspects of our work, <b>students</b> curious about synthetic biology, and members of the <b>general public</b> who had never encountered this field before. We also met individuals who expressed interest in becoming future iGEM participants, showing how <b>effective science communication can inspire the next generation of scientists.</b></p>
