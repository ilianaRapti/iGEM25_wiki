              <p>Our team attended the <b>31st Scientific Congress of Hellenic Medical Students</b>, a three-day event with over 2,000 attendees. Although our project focuses on environmental issues, specifically the plane tree disease, the broader implications of this work touch upon <b>public health and cultural heritage</b>, making it relevant to medical professionals as well. This conference was an opportunity to <b>share our work with a new audience</b>, demonstrating how interdisciplinary collaboration strengthens both science and community resilience.</p>

              <p>To officially participate, we first reached out to the conference’s organizing committee. Through our discussions, we secured booth space in the main exhibition area.</p>
              <p>We prepared a range of materials:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Informational leaflets</b> detailing our project and synthetic biology concepts in simple, engaging language.</li>
                <li><b>Stickers</b> featuring our team logo as a fun takeaway for visitors.</li>
                <li><b>Booth design</b> aimed at encouraging open, meaningful conversations.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Our focus was on accessibility: clear visuals, approachable explanations, and a welcoming atmosphere.</p>

              <p>For three consecutive days, our booth was active and well-visited. We spoke with hundreds of medical students, many of whom were curious about how a plant disease could have relevance to their future medical careers.</p>
              <p>Some conversations were particularly touching:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Students shared <b>personal stories</b> about childhood memories connected to plane trees they had seen become diseased and cut down.</li>
                <li>Others expressed interest in joining future iGEM projects, recognizing the interdisciplinary nature of our work.</li>

              <p>These interactions highlighted how environmental and human health are deeply interconnected.</p>
