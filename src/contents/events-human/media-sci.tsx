        <p>
          Research only reaches its full impact when it is understood and appreciated by society. 
          Our team leveraged national and educational media to connect complex synthetic biology 
          projects with real-world problems that matter to local communities. Our 2025 project, 
          focusing on plane tree conservation, links scientific innovation with cultural and 
          environmental heritage, illustrating the power of science to address pressing ecological 
          challenges.

            <b>Media Coverage</b>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            <b>ERT News</b>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            ERT News presented the team’s project as “pioneering research”, emphasizing the 
            innovation and urgency of protecting Greece’s plane trees. The coverage highlighted 
            the team’s proactive role in tackling an environmental threat that affects local 
            ecosystems and communities.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            
            <b>Alfavita.gr</b>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Alfavita.gr focused on the educational and interdisciplinary aspects of the project, 
            portraying the team as young scientists applying advanced biotechnology to real-world 
            challenges. The article demonstrated how student-driven initiatives can combine 
            curiosity, technical expertise and social responsibility to create meaningful impact.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            <b>In.gr</b>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In.gr framed the plane tree decline in its national context, explaining the fungus’s 
            introduction to Greece in the early 2000s and its spread to multiple regions, including 
            Ioannina. The coverage emphasized the ecological and cultural significance of the 
            affected trees and described the team’s proposed molecular approach to control the 
            pathogen. Funding support from the Region of Epirus and the team’s previous iGEM 
            successes with the ATROPOS project were also highlighted.

            <br></br><br></br>
            We also gave an interview to <b>Vasiliki Michopoulou</b>, 
            who works in science communication and we 
            collaborated with the <b>Municipality of Ioannina</b> and 
            <b>the Mayor of Ioannina</b>.
          </p>

        <div className="media3-text-sci">
          <p>
            These media collaborations show that science communication can be both <b>informative 
            and inspiring</b>. By combining factual accuracy with storytelling, we illustrated that 
            research has societal value beyond the laboratory. Our approach demonstrates that 
            <b> interdisciplinary science</b>, when communicated thoughtfully, can spark awareness, 
            appreciation, and even collective action to preserve the environment and cultural 
            heritage.
            <br></br><br></br>

            Through this process, we learned how to translate complex research into clear 
            public messages, strengthening trust and engagement. The collaborations <b>broadened 
            the audience for synthetic biology</b>, built media relationships, and provided real-world 
            feedback that will guide future outreach. Most importantly, the experience confirmed 
            that story-driven communication can mobilize people around a shared environmental 
            cause.
