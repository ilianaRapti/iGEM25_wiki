        <p>
          Our team organized an event for children called “The Forest of Dreams”, inspired by the 
          title of our original fairytale. The event took place on the island of Kyra Frosini, in 
          Lake Pamvotida, under the shade of a centuries-old plane tree. With this action, our goal 
          was to <b>open the world of science to children in an approachable way</b>, showing them that 
          biology can be fun, understandable, and accessible to everyone, no matter their age.

            We collaborated with the <b>English Preparatory School</b> “Drakopoulou Maria-Nektaria” 
            and welcomed 25 children to participate in our program. The event was designed to 
            be simple, warm, and engaging: we prepared blankets for everyone to sit on the ground, 
            close to the lake, and we created a sequence of activities that combined storytelling, 
            science communication, and play.

            We began with a mini-presentation about who we are, what challenges plane trees 
            face and our project. We used simple words, analogies, and vivid examples so that 
            children could follow along with ease. To make the process inclusive, we constantly 
            <b> encouraged participation</b> through questions, giving every child the chance to think, 
            answer, and explore the concepts themselves. The program then moved to creative 
            activities: drawing nature, coloring scenes from our fairytale, and using our original 
            activity book. Later, children enjoyed a piñata filled with treats and our stickers, 
            followed by a treasure hunt with small riddles about nature and biology. Every child 
            found a role in this journey of discovery.

              The event was filled with joy and energy. The children not only participated 
              actively, but they also became co-creators of knowledge by asking questions 
              themselves. Parents, who attended from a distance, expressed curiosity and asked 
              us more about our project, proving that the event reached beyond the children to 
              the whole community. At the end, the children shouted “Thank you iGEM IOANNINA!”—a 
              sweet moment that highlighted how deeply they felt part of our action.

                This action was inclusive because it <b>broke the stereotype that science is too 
                difficult or distant for young learners</b>. We showed that biology can be explained 
                in a way that everyone can understand. The event gave children access to 
                knowledge that schools often don’t provide, fostering curiosity about trees 
                and diseases in an age-appropriate way. <b>By engaging them in multiple forms</b>—visual 
                (drawing), physical (treasure hunt), and social (discussion)—we ensured that every 
                child, regardless of learning style, could connect with science.

              <p>
                As a team, we saw that inclusivity in science means more than simplifying—it 
                means creating an environment where children feel empowered to ask, share, 
                and think critically. This experience reminded us that when science is presented 
                in the right way, <b>no one is left out</b>.
