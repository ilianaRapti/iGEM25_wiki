      {/* Introduction section */}
        <p>
            On September 6th, our team hosted a one-day conference titled 
            <b>“The Plane Tree and the Canker Stain Disease”</b> at the Department 
            of Biological Applications and Technologies.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

           The event brought together:
           <ul>
            <li>Faculty members and researchers from our department,</li>
            <li>Members of the Forest Service and municipal organizations,</li>
            <li>Citizens deeply concerned about the issue, either personally or professionally,</li>
            <li>Online participants from other regions.</li>
           </ul>

           Our primary aim was to inform the public about canker stain disease (Ceratocystis platani) and to present our project in a way that was clear and accessible to all.
           <br></br>
           By creating an inclusive environment, we sought to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, could understand and engage with our work.

            To reach a diverse audience, we focused on accessibility and clear communication:         
            <br></br>

           <ul>
            <li>Designed posters and prepared social media campaigns to promote the event widely.</li>
            <li>Planned inclusive materials, including our storybooks in Braille and standard print, and an educational puzzle inspired by one of the stories.</li>
           <li>Chose a hybrid format, allowing both in-person and online participation to ensure accessibility for those unable to attend physically.</li>
           </ul>

           Our team carefully prepared a presentation that explained both the science behind the disease and the goals of our project using simple language and visual aids.

                This event demonstrated how science and society are interconnected:
                <ul>
                    <li>Citizens need to understand what scientists are working on, especially when it directly impacts their environment and daily lives.</li>
                    <li>Researchers, in turn, have the responsibility to communicate clearly and involve communities in the problem-solving process.</li>
                    <li>By creating a space where experts and non-experts interact, we built trust and showed that everyone’s perspective matters in addressing ecological challenges.</li>
                </ul>
                Inclusivity here was not just about accessibility—it was about shared ownership of the problem and its solutions.

            <div className="gain-text-inclu-conf">
              <p>
                Through this event, we learned:
                <ul>
                    <li>The importance of listening to local voices and incorporating their concerns into our research.</li>
                    <li>How to communicate complex scientific ideas in ways that resonate with diverse audiences.</li>
                    <li>That collaboration between science and society creates a stronger, more resilient path forward.</li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                
                Most importantly, we saw that when citizens are included and informed, 
                they become <b>active partners</b> in the mission to protect both our natural 
                environment and our shared cultural heritage.
