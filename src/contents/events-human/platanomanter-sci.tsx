              <p>As part of our iGEM journey, we aimed not only to develop a scientific solution but also to communicate science in a meaningful and relatable way. To achieve this, we created a 30-minute documentary, <b>PLÁTANOS</b>—a name inspired by the Greek word Platanos (plane tree). Our film focused on the cultural, social, and ecological importance of plane trees in Epirus, and the urgent threat they face from the fungus Ceratocystis platani. By combining scientific facts with personal stories, traditions, and emotions, we transformed a technical subject into a narrative that could engage a broad audience.</p>

              <p>The success of this documentary relied heavily on preparation. We carefully planned the inclusion of voices from different backgrounds: scientists and agronomists who could provide technical expertise, local leaders and villagers who could share their personal and cultural experiences, and an artist who expressed the symbolic value of the trees through creativity. Our team also took care to develop clear and simple questions that would allow complex ideas to be communicated in an accessible way. By choosing interviewees who could speak to <b>both the scientific and emotional aspects of the issue</b>, we laid the foundation for a documentary that was understandable, engaging, and relatable.</p>

              <p>The filming included diverse scenes and formats to make the science accessible and appealing. We shot footage at the plane trees of Ioannina, where we explained shortly our mission, and in the villages of Syrrako and Vitsa. Through interviews, locals described their memories and traditions linked to plane trees, while experts highlighted the biology of plane trees and their impact. Video calls expanded our reach, allowing us to include an artist inspired by the trees, a villager from Iliochori—home to the largest plane tree in Greece—, professors from our university and a graduate from the department of Biological Applications and Technologies who had studied specifically Ceratocystis platani. Each of these perspectives helped translate science into human terms, <b>showing how biology intersects with culture and daily life</b>.</p>

              <p>The final documentary was published on our YouTube channel and subtitled in different languages, broadening accessibility beyond Greece. To further increase its reach, we repurposed sections into short reels for Instagram and TikTok, allowing younger audiences to engage with the content in formats they are most familiar with. In this way, we ensured that the scientific problem of canker stain was not confined to academic or local discussions but instead reached national and even international audiences. By blending storytelling, interviews, and scientific explanation, our action demonstrated that science communication can be both informative and emotionally resonant.</p>

              <p>Our documentary helped raise awareness by presenting the threat of <i>Ceratocystis platani</i> in a way that was scientifically accurate but also accessible to non-specialists. By doing so, we made it possible for anyone—whether a villager, a student, or someone watching online across the world—to understand the importance of protecting these trees. This action exemplified how science can <b>build bridges between laboratories, local communities and the wider public.</b></p>
