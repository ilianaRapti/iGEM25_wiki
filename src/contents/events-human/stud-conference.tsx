              <p>On May 16th, our team had the opportunity to participate in the <b>1st Panhellenic Student Conference of Pedagogical Education</b> at the University of Ioannina. We presented our educational activity “Exploring the World of Plants through Interactive Videos”, with the title “Discovering the Magical World of Plants: Interactive learning for little explorers”, under the category <b>Science Teaching and Sustainability Education</b>. The aim of this action was to highlight the importance of teaching nature-related topics at an early age and to showcase how science can be made more fun, simple and accessible. We believe that science is not only about complex theories or technical words—it can also be a playful and approachable experience for everyone.</p>

              <p>The main concept behind our activity was inclusivity. Many children, especially at a young age, do not have the chance to learn about science in engaging and enjoyable ways. Our educational design therefore focused on making plant biology approachable for all learners, regardless of their background or prior knowledge. To achieve this, we created a PowerPoint presentation for the attendees and an original educational video enriched with animations and drawings. These materials were chosen so that different types of learners—visual, auditory, or experiential—could engage meaningfully with the content.</p>

              <p>During the conference, we first introduced our team and the educational purpose of our activity. We then presented a PowerPoint that explained the basics of plant biology in a structured but simple way. To enhance understanding, we showed the video we had created, where our team members explained concepts like photosynthesis and plant structures while colorful animations and hand-drawn illustrations brought the information to life. This combination of media ensured inclusivity by appealing to different attention spans and learning styles, making the topic accessible even to audiences that might otherwise find science intimidating or dull.</p>

              <p>The interactive approach immediately caught the attention of the audience. The pedagogists in attendance not only engaged actively with our material but also expressed strong interest in adapting such methods for their own students. They highlighted how this approach could make children feel more included in the learning process, especially those who might struggle with traditional lecture-based teaching. Importantly, two educators expressed interest in collaborating with us in the future and a student from the Department of Pedagogical Education asked if students from her department could be part of our team. The evaluation stage, which involved questions, feedback and open discussion, allowed participants to reflect on how the method could be further enriched. Importantly, the activity gave future educators that attended the presentation, and to a greater extent children, an opportunity to see science as something approachable, relatable and part of everyday life.</p>

              <p>Inclusivity in science education is not simply about providing access to knowledge; it is about <b>offering different pathways to understanding</b>, so that no child feels excluded. By combining visuals, storytelling, interactivity and experiential elements, our action broke away from rigid teaching formats and embraced diversity in learning. Teaching plant biology in this way allows children of different backgrounds, abilities, and learning styles to feel equally capable of understanding and appreciating nature. Furthermore, nurturing curiosity about plants and the environment at a young age contributes to building responsible future citizens who value sustainability. Lastly, we introduced future educators to new ways of teaching. This will have an impact in the future as they will practically apply what they learned in their classroom. </p>

              <p>This action once again was for us an exercise in science communication and inclusivity. We learned how to adapt complex biological concepts into simple, relatable explanations and how to use creative tools to make our message engaging. We also gained valuable feedback from pedagogists, which helped us reflect on the role of inclusivity in science education. Most importantly, this experience strengthened our belief that science is for everyone and that making it accessible to young learners is a powerful step toward shaping a more informed and environmentally conscious society.</p>
