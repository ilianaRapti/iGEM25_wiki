              <p><b>International Women’s Day</b> is a global occasion that honors women’s achievements while drawing attention to the barriers they continue to face. Women remain underrepresented in STEM worldwide, often encountering structural, cultural and societal challenges. UNESCO’s Cracking the Code report (2017) shows that gender stereotypes and lack of role models continue to discourage girls and women from pursuing science careers. Similarly, the European Commission’s She Figures 2021 highlights persistent gaps in academic positions and leadership roles across Europe.</p>
              <p>Our iGEM team wanted to use this day as an opportunity to listen, learn and spark conversation within our university about equality in science. By engaging with students directly, we aimed to capture authentic voices and perspectives—especially from women in our community.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Anonymous Questionnaire → distributed to the student body through academic email.</li>
                <li>Interactive Stand → outside the main cafeteria, inviting students to reflect on challenges women face in science.</li>

              <p><b>Activity 1: Questionnaire</b><br />We designed a seven-question survey covering opportunities for women in science, career advancement, and academic challenges. More than 500 students responded—most of them women. Unfortunately, no non-binary representation was recorded.</p>
              <p><b>Key insights:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Equal opportunities:</b> Only 56% believed women enjoy equal opportunities in academia.</li>
                <li><b>Career advancement:</b> 45% disagreed that women have equal chances to progress.</li>
                <li><b>Gender imbalance:</b> 70% acknowledged it in their field of study.</li>
                <li><b>Cause of imbalance:</b> 59% linked it to stereotypical beliefs, echoing findings in the National Academies report Promising Practices for Addressing the Underrepresentation of Women in Science (2020).</li>
                <li><b>Discrimination:</b> Less than 15% felt more discriminated against inside academia than outside.</li>
                <li><b>Leadership roles:</b> Opinions were split, but only 3% strongly doubted women could achieve professorships.</li>
                <li><b>Role models:</b> Encouragingly, 88% reported having at least one female academic staff member as a role model.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Activity 2: Cafeteria Stand</b><br />At our stand, students answered the question:“What is the biggest challenge women encounter in the scientific field?” We collected 70 anonymous answers. Common themes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gender stereotypes and patriarchal attitudes.</li>
                <li>Lack of institutional or family support.</li>
                <li>Cultural discrimination and marginalization.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Activity 3: Video Interviews at the Lake of Ioannina</b><br />For the final phase, we recorded street-style interviews with passing students at the Lake of Ioannina. Their answers were compiled into a short video shared on social media. The response was overwhelming: the video reached more than 20,000 views, eight times higher than our usual engagement. The perspectives students shared were diverse, personal and powerful, making the issue feel real and urgent.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>Data and Insights:</b> Over 500 survey responses, plus dozens of open answers.</li>
                <li><b>Engagement:</b> Hundreds of students interacted with our team.</li>
                <li><b>Visibility:</b> Our video reached an audience far larger than usual.</li>
                <li><b>Empowerment:</b> Women voiced their experiences and expressed gratitude for the platform.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Our three activities created a layered picture of how gender equality in science is viewed at our university. While many students recognized progress, they also pointed out persistent barriers: stereotypes, systemic challenges and uneven representation. At the same time, the recognition of female role models—reported by almost 90% of respondents—offers hope. According to UN Women’s Gender Snapshot 2022, visibility of women in leadership is a key factor in encouraging younger generations to pursue STEM. Our findings echoed this: role models matter! Beyond the numbers, our initiative helped normalize dialogue about gender equality in an academic setting where it is often overlooked.</p>

              <p>Marking International Women’s Day in this way was not just about celebration. It was about sparking critical reflection and giving visibility to voices often underrepresented in academic discussions. By collecting and sharing real opinions, we <b>revealed the gap</b> between institutional values and lived experiences.</p>
              <p>Our initiative also aligns with global observations: the European Commission’s She Figures 2021 confirms that women remain underrepresented in higher academic positions, despite increasing participation at the student level. Activities like ours show that universities can play an active role in bridging this gap.</p>

      <b>Introduction</b>
      <ul>
        <li>International Women’s Day honors women’s achievements. It also reminds us of the barriers women still face.</li>
        <li>Team did three main activities at University of Ioannina</li>
        <ul>
          <li>An anonymous questionnaire.</li>
          <li>A stand outside the cafeteria.</li>
          <li>Short interviews at Lake Ioannina.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      The goal: understand how students see gender equality in science, with a focus on women’s experiences.
    
    <br></br>
    <br></br>

    <b>Organization</b>
    <br></br>
    We planned three actions:
    <ul>
      <li>A survey sent to all students.</li>
      <li>An interactive stand with one question.</li>
      <li>Street-style interviews, later edited into a video.</li>
    </ul>
    Different formats, same goal: gather opinions, start conversations, spread awareness.
    <br></br>
    <br></br>

    <b>Implementation</b>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    Activity 1: Questionnaire
    <ul>
      <li>Sent by email.</li>
      <li>Seven questions.</li>
      <li>500+ responses (mostly women).</li>
    </ul>

    Highlights:
    <ul>
      <li>56% believe women have equal opportunities in academia.</li>
      <li>45% disagreed women have equal chances for career growth.</li>
      <li>70% saw gender imbalance in their field.</li>
      <li>59% blamed stereotypes—similar to findings in the National Academies (2020) report.</li>
      <li>Less than 15% felt more discriminated inside academia than outside.</li>
      <li>Leadership chances: mixed answers, but almost no one “strongly disagreed.”</li>
      <li>88% had at least one female academic role model.</li>
    </ul>

    Activity 2: Cafeteria Stand
    <br></br>
    We asked: <i>“What is the biggest challenge women face in science?”</i>
    <ul>
      <li>70 students answered.</li>
      <li>Main themes: stereotypes, patriarchy, lack of support.</li>
    </ul>
    This gave us one-on-one conversations and a chance to share what iGEM is.
    <br></br>
    <br></br>

    Activity 3: Video Interviews
    <br></br>
    At Lake Ioannina, we asked students about obstacles for women in science.
    <ul>
      <li>We made a short video with their answers.</li>
      <li>It reached 20,000+ views—eight times higher than our usual posts.</li>
      <li>UN Women’s Gender Snapshot 2022 stresses the importance of visibility; our video was one way to contribute to that.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Outcomes And Results</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Survey: showed progress but also clear gaps.</li>
      <li>Stand: created direct dialogue with students.</li>
      <li>Video: reached a huge audience and spread awareness.</li>
    </ul>
    Together, these actions gave us both data and personal stories.
    <br></br>
    <br></br>

    <b>Why is this important?</b>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    This project made the issue visible. It showed that progress exists, but barriers remain. Our findings match broader reports like She Figures 2021, which shows women are still underrepresented in higher-level science roles.
    By giving women at our university a platform, we helped start conversations that are often missing in academic spaces.
    <br></br>
    <br></br>

    <b>What did we gain?</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Data on gender equality in STEM at our university.</li>
      <li>Engagement from more than 500 students.</li>
      <li>Visibility for our team and iGEM.</li>
      <li>Pride in giving women space to speak and be heard.</li>
    </ul>
