                        <p>The <b>Thessaloniki International Fair</b> (TIF), one of Greece's largest public events, was a unique chance to show that synthetic biology is for everyone. By stepping outside the academic setting, we connected with people from all walks of life — from professors and researchers to families, students, and even a high school <b>STEAM</b> team. We also exchanged ideas with university student teams from across Greece, all eager to hear about our project <b>AMADRYADS</b> and our business model Halocrops.
                        Our goal was to spark curiosity and build an inclusive, welcoming space where science
                        felt engaging and relevant to everyday life.

                        <p>To ensure accessibility, we designed our booth to be both informative and approachable. <b>Flyers</b> explained our project in simple terms, stickers offered a playful way to remember us, and our crocheted plane tree mascot, <b>NARA</b>, drew visitors in naturally. We also prepared to adjust our communication style, making sure that people of every academic and age background — from school students to professionals — could engage with our work meaningfully.</p>

                        <p>Throughout the fair, our booth was continuously staffed so every visitor could engage in conversation. We met families, school groups, professors, researchers, and student-led teams. Many people from Thessaly — a region heavily affected by plane tree canker <b>stain</b> — shared their experiences, even mentioning <b>villages named Platanos</b> that had tragically lost all their trees. These discussions made our project feel especially personal and emphasized how science connects directly to people’s lives.</p>

Thessalian visitors highlighted the urgency of our project, while professors offered valuable feedback and students expressed interest in joining future iGEM competitions. Our talks on <b><i>Halocrops</i></b> showed how synthetic biology can bridge science and entrepreneurship, while our flyers and stickers helped extend our outreach beyond the fair.</p>

Inclusivity allowed us to transform our booth into a space where science was approachable, relevant, and shared.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Learned how to explain science to different audiences.</li>
                <li>Built connections with teams, educators, and community members.</li>
                <li>Saw the power of listening to those affected.</li>
                <li>Learned inclusivity is not just an idea—it’s something you <i>do</i>.</li>
