            In April 2025, our team joined the <b>31st Scientific Congress of Hellenic 
            Medical Students</b> in Thessaloniki, an event that brought together more than 
            <b>2,000 students</b> from across Greece. Although our project focuses on 
            environmental synthetic biology, we used this medical congress to tell a 
            broader story: the conservation of Greece’s plane trees.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

                We set up a <b>booth</b> designed for dialogue—<b>leaflets, stickers, and 
                visuals</b> made our work approachable, while conversations brought it to life. 
                Medical students learned about CRISPR and fungal disease, but also shared 
                personal memories of the plane trees in their hometowns. These stories turned 
                complex science into something <b>familiar and deeply cultural</b>.
                <br></br>
            <br></br>

                The experience showed us that <b>science communication</b> thrives when it 
                crosses disciplines. By framing synthetic biology in terms of environmental
                and community health, we connected with an <b>unexpected audience</b>, proving 
                that science can resonate with anyone when told through shared values 
                and stories.
