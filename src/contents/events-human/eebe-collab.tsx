              <p>Through this collaboration, we not only presented our own perspective but also connected with another team that shares the same challenges, achievements, and aspirations within the iGEM competition. The event helped us strengthen our ties with the <b>iGEM community</b>, establish a foundation for future cooperation, and develop a sense of noble rivalry that motivates us to evolve further. Meeting the iGEM Thrace team was a truly inspiring moment that left us with new ideas, mutual respect, and the beginning of a promising friendship between our teams.</p>
