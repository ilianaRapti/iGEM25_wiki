            <p>
                On June 18th, our team participated in the “Women in History 
                Afternoon Tea” event at Epirus Palace Hotel, organized by The 
                English Workshop. While the children celebrated historical female 
                figures, our role was to bring science into the conversation. 
                This gave us the chance to practice science communication—sharing our 
                work in ways that were clear, engaging, and inspiring for both children 
                and adults.

                    The event combined history, performance, and science. Each child 
                    researched a woman from history, embodied her through costume and 
                    presentation, and performed a short sketch. Our team was invited to 
                    complement this with a science communication activity that highlighted 
                    women in STEM today. Our responsibilities included:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Explaining iGEM in simple, accessible language.</li>
                        <li>Presenting our project in a way that young students could follow.</li>
                        <li>Sharing the results of our survey conducted for the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.</li>
                    </ul>

                    We began by introducing iGEM as a story of teamwork, collaboration, 
                    and creative problem-solving, rather than technical details. 
                    Our project was described in simplified terms, focusing on real-world 
                    impact instead of jargon. This storytelling approach made it possible 
                    for children to connect with the concepts while keeping parents and 
                    teachers engaged.<br></br>
                    We then presented the results of our survey on women in science, 
                    which opened a thoughtful dialogue with the audience. The fact that 
                    both children and adults asked questions showed that our message was 
                    not only understood but also thought-provoking.

                    <br></br><br></br>

                    The event demonstrated how effective communication can make science 
                    accessible to a wide and diverse audience. By linking history with 
                    contemporary STEM, we helped participants see that women’s achievements 
                    are part of a continuous story that extends into today’s labs and 
                    classrooms. Children discovered that science is not distant or 
                    intimidating but approachable and relevant to their lives.

                    Science communication bridges the gap between knowledge and society. 
                    For children, it breaks down barriers that often make science seem 
                    inaccessible. For parents and teachers, it shows how science can be 
                    explained in inclusive, engaging ways. By practicing science 
                    communication in this event, we reinforced the idea that science 
                    belongs to everyone, not just specialists.

                    Our team strengthened its ability to adapt scientific concepts 
                    for different audiences. We learned to combine storytelling with 
                    scientific content, making our message impactful across age groups. 
                    This experience confirmed the importance of science communication in 
                    iGEM: it is not only about doing science but also about ensuring that 
                    science is shared, understood, and valued by all.
