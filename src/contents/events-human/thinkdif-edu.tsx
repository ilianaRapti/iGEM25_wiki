              <p>Our team organized a one-day event titled “Think Different, Learn Together” at the Academia of Ioannina to engage high school students with science and introduce them to the world of synthetic biology. This educational action aimed to combine knowledge-sharing with practical, hands-on activities that would help students learn about our project, core biological concepts and possible career pathways in science.</p>

              <p>Five high schools from Ioannina (High School of Eleousa, 5th General High School of Ioannina, General High School of Pedini, General High School of Anatoli and Arsakeio School) and 15 people from ELEPAP (Rehabilitation for the Disabled, a non-profit charity organization in Greece) attended the conference, with a total of 90 students. We designed the event to provide a mix of theoretical knowledge, interactive engagement, and practical experience. To enrich the program, we invited distinguished speakers: Dr. Michaelidis (professor of Molecular Genetics, University of Ioannina) and Dr. Alivertis (Organic Chemistry professor, University of Ioannina), as well as a representative from iGEM IOANNINA 2024. Our own team members also contributed by presenting the event, our project and running educational mini-workshops during the break.</p>

They then participated in a “Myth or Truth” quiz that tested their understanding and consolidated their learning.</p>
              <p>During the big break, our team provided diverse learning stations:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Board games, puzzles, fairytales, and a video game</b> to make scientific concepts fun and approachable.</li>
                <li><b>Career orientation bench</b>, where students received firsthand advice from university students of different disciplines.</li>
                <li><b>Scientific workshops</b> with microscopes, stereoscopes, and mock microbiology experiments using safe materials to simulate lab techniques.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The event concluded with a live chemistry show, where students learned basic chemical principles through entertaining, impressive, real-time experiments.</p>

              <p>The students demonstrated strong learning outcomes, shown by their high success rates in the “Myth or Truth” quiz: on each question on synthetic biology and our project the correct answers were between 80% and 100%. They were able to recall and apply new information, confirming that the presentations had educational value. Teachers reported that students were more engaged than expected, asking questions about science careers and showing great enthusiasm during the workshops. The direct experience of handling microscopes and mock lab materials was particularly impactful, giving them a taste of what laboratory work involves. Last but not least, all of the teachers expressed their interest in inviting us at their school to make a presentation to the rest of the school community as well, as they felt like the problem we are focusing on should be known by everyone at Ioannina. One of them proposed we do a one-day event at their school too.</p>

              <p>Educational outreach actions like this are crucial because they bridge the gap between classroom learning and real scientific practice. By making advanced fields like synthetic biology understandable and accessible, we inspire students to view science as something they can actively engage in, not just read about. Moreover, introducing them to career paths in science broadens their horizons and supports informed decision-making about their future studies. Such experiences cultivate curiosity, critical thinking, and confidence in young learners.</p>
