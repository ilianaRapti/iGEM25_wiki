              <p>On September 25th, our team carried out an <b>educational action</b> at the <b>Special Education School of Ioannina</b> with 70 students from both junior-high and high school. Our purpose was to <b>introduce them to biology in a simple, engaging way</b>, while also showing them <b>how science connects to their everyday lives and local environment</b>. We aimed to make life science approachable, not intimidating, and to spark curiosity for contemporary scientific topics.</p>

              <p>The program was divided into two sessions: one for high school and one for junior-high students. Before the activities began, pupils completed a short questionnaire to assess their initial knowledge of biology and their ability to identify healthy and diseased plane trees—a subject directly relevant to the local environment. Our materials combined traditional science communication with creative approaches such as storytelling, games, and art.</p>
              <p>Before our activity, we met with the teacher of the Special School to get advice on what to avoid and which activities to choose, so that everyone would feel equal regardless of their abilities.</p>

              <p>We began with a <b>short presentation</b> introducing ourselves, our mission, and the basics of synthetic biology. The explanations were simplified to remain accessible, and a microphone was used to ensure clarity for all learners. We encouraged participation through questions like <b>“What words come to mind when you hear the word biology?”</b> which helped pupils link life science to their prior knowledge.</p>
              <p>The fairytale we created was used to explain concepts in a fun and memorable way, followed by a short Q&A to reinforce understanding. Then, students engaged in <b>three activity stations</b>: creating clay leaves, playing a life science-themed board game and writing in a notebook, and expressing biology through drawing. With the junior-high pupils, we also added a music-kinetic activity, where they danced as fairies from the story, combining creativity, movement, and science.</p>

              <p>The educational value of this action is twofold: students were introduced to synthetic biology—an emerging scientific field—and they also learned about plane tree disease, a crucial issue for their local ecosystem. By connecting cutting-edge science with an environmental problem that directly concerns their land, the action bridged abstract knowledge with real-life relevance. Making life sciences approachable in this way can help reduce fear or indifference toward science and encourage pupils to view it as a tool for solving real problems.</p>

This reinforced our belief that education is most powerful when it is interactive, local, and creative.</p>
