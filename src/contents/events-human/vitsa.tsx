              <p>In Vitsa, a <b>UNESCO-protected village</b> in Zagori, our team held an interactive event for children in collaboration with the local "KDAP RODA - Creative Activities Center for Children of Ioannina". This activity aimed to bring science into a playful and creative environment where children aged 6 to 12 could <b>learn</b>, <b>ask questions</b> and <b>connect</b> with our project. Beyond science education, the event was about <b>inclusivity</b>: designing experiences where every child, regardless of age or background, could engage meaningfully and feel part of the conversation.</p>

              <p>We worked closely with the KDAP center and ecology professor Dr. Stara, who guided the children in connecting with their natural environment. Together, we built a program with different layers of accessibility:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>A fairytale</b> (The Girl and the Plane Tree) to introduce concepts of DNA and life’s “building blocks”.</li>
                <li><b>Interactive exercises</b> (crosswords, word searches, matching games) linked to our project.</li>
                <li><b>A drawing space</b> where children could create freely and ask spontaneous questions.</li>
                <li>A symbolic <b>“Tree of Memories”</b>, where children wrote wishes for the plane trees on paper leaves and added them to a large paper tree.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This planning ensured that regardless of age or learning style, every child had a way to participate.</p>

              <p>During the event, we first read our <b>fairytale</b>. One child immediately connected the <b>“blocks of life”</b> in the story to DNA parts, showing how storytelling can spark understanding. Other children asked why plane trees were sick, how fungi spread and what could be done to protect trees. We explained <b>fungal transmission, sanitary pruning practices</b> and the <b>role of microorganisms</b>, adjusting our language to the children’s level of knowledge.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the “Tree of Memories” became an emotional centerpiece: the children’s leaves carried messages like “get well soon”, “thank you for oxygen” and “I hope you get better”. These simple wishes reflected genuine <b>empathy</b> and <b>awareness</b> of the trees’ importance for both nature and community.</p>
              <p>Parents, visitors and passersby joined in, creating an intergenerational and spontaneous atmosphere. Some even offered to contribute to our plane tree documentary, Platanos.</p>

              <p>The event achieved <b>inclusivity</b> in practice:</p>
              <p>Children as young as six years old engaged with synthetic biology concepts in ways suited to their level.</p>
              <p>Older children asked deeper scientific questions, bridging <b>curiosity</b> with <b>real-life applications</b>. One of these questions was particularly striking: “Why are so many trees sick?” This opened a discussion on the ways the disease spreads, where we explained the role of fungi and how infections can move from tree to tree. At the end of this exchange, a child concluded with a thoughtful realization: “Oh, so if the tools are properly disinfected, the plane trees can be saved?” —a moment that highlighted both their critical thinking and the <b>power</b> of dialogue in <b>making complex topics understandable</b>.</p>

              <p>Parents and community members also became part of the discussion, asking how they themselves could contribute and become part of our effort.

By blending storytelling, games, science, and creative expression, we ensured that every child felt <b>capable</b> of contributing.

This approach validated our belief that inclusivity enriches both the community and our project.</p>

              <p>This event taught us how to adapt scientific language to very young audiences, an essential skill for <b>making synthetic biology accessible</b>. Also, one of the most important lessons from this activity was understanding that inclusivity also means recognizing the different needs and interests of each age group.</p>
              <p>While younger children engaged deeply with drawing and storytelling, we noticed that children over 10 years old were less impressed by these activities. This insight showed us that inclusivity is more about tailoring experiences so that every child feels <b>challenged</b> and <b>inspired</b> at their own level.</p>
              <p>From this realization came a new idea: a <b>board game</b> for older children, mixing elements of taboo, charades, and quiz-style questions on synthetic biology and plane trees. This way, participants engage with science in line with their curiosity and critical thinking, while keeping the playfulness alive.</p>
              <p>By adapting our tools, we expand inclusivity—not just inviting every child, but <b>creating ways</b> for different ages and learning styles to connect meaningfully with science. For our team, the Vitsa event was more than outreach—it reminded us that inclusivity means listening, adapting, and letting new voices shape the conversation.</p>

  <p><b>Vitsa Inclusivity</b></p>

    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We visited Vitsa, a UNESCO-protected village in Zagori.</li>
      <li>
        Thanks to the "KDAP RODA - Creative Activities Center for Children of Ioannina", we got to meet kids (ages 6–12).
      </li>
      <li>Aim: share our project in a fun, simple and inclusive way.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Organization</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborated with KDAP center and ecology professor Dr. Stara.</li>
      <li>Prepared age-appropriate tools:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Fairytale: <i>The Girl and the Plane Tree</i></li>
        <li>Puzzle and Activity Book</li>
        <li>Drawing corner</li>
        <li>“Tree of Memories” activity</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Implementation</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read our fairytale → kids linked DNA “building blocks” to story.</li>
      <li>Puzzle & Activity Book → kept everyone engaged.</li>
      <li>
        “Tree of Memories” → kids wrote wishes for plane trees such as, “get well soon,” “thank you for oxygen”.
      </li>
      <li>Kids asked about DNA, fungi and how trees get sick.</li>
      <li>Parents and bystanders also joined in too!</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Outcomes and Results</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kids understood key concepts: DNA parts, fungal infection and sanitary practices.</li>
      <li>
        Parents and visitors showed strong interest → offered help for our documentary and told us their own stories about plane trees.
      </li>
      <li>Emotional connection built through kids’ drawings and wishes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Why Is This Important</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Science became inclusive: children, parents and villagers all joined.</li>
      <li>Mixed ages (6–12) showed us inclusivity is about adjusting content for everyone.</li>
      <li>Collaborating with KDAP and Dr. Stara strengthened community links.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>What Did We Gain</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to explain synthetic biology in a simple way.</li>
      <li>Saw emotional engagement through children’s wishes.</li>
      <li>Built bonds with both the kids and the wider community.</li>
      <li>Realized inclusivity = listening, adapting and creating space for all voices.</li>
      <li>
        We realized older kids wanted more challenges — so we made a board game! Think taboo, charades and quiz, based on synthetic biology and plane trees.
      </li>
    </ul>
