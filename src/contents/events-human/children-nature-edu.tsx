        <p>Our team hosted an event called “The Forest of Dreams” at the <b>island of Kyra Frosini</b>, surrounded by the natural beauty of <b>Lake Pamvotida</b>. The aim of this program was to introduce children to biology and our project in a fun and educational way, while placing them directly in nature to experience the importance of trees and ecosystems.</p>

          <p>We collaborated with the <b>English Preparatory School</b> “Drakopoulou Maria-Nektaria” and welcomed 25 enthusiastic children. The action was carefully designed to combine short presentations, interactive discussions, artistic activities, and playful challenges—so that learning was never abstract but connected to real experiences.</p>

          <p>We began with a presentation of our team, the plane trees and their threat as well as our solution. To make the science approachable, we used simple language, analogies, and everyday examples. Instead of passively receiving information, the children were engaged in a dialogue: we asked them questions, encouraged critical thinking, and guided them toward discovering knowledge themselves. Afterward, they participated in creative activities, such as drawing nature, coloring our fairytale-inspired pages, and working with our activity book. Finally, we organized playful yet educational challenges: a piñata filled with small surprises and a treasure hunt with riddles about biology, plane trees, and our project.</p>

            <p>The children not only had fun but also learned about the role of plane trees in the environment and the importance of protecting them. They connected science with tangible images, play, and nature itself. Their enthusiasm was visible: they answered eagerly, asked thoughtful questions, and actively engaged in every step. Parents also became curious about our work, which shows that the event spread awareness beyond the children. On our way back to Ioannina, the children shouted all together “Thank you, iGEM IOANNINA!”.</p>

              <p>This action was important because it proved that science can be <b>both educational and enjoyable</b>. The children learned about biology not in a classroom, but outdoors, where trees, water, and fresh air made the lesson more alive and memorable. They discovered concepts that are rarely included in school curricula—such as tree diseases and ecosystem health—while associating science with positive emotions and play. By combining knowledge and fun, we made science less intimidating and more approachable, planting the seed of curiosity for the future.</p>

              <p>We learned how to translate complex scientific ideas into something children can understand, appreciate, and remember. Most importantly, we realized that educational actions outside the classroom—especially in nature—have a unique power to inspire young minds. This reinforced our belief that sharing knowledge with the next generation is one of the most meaningful ways to protect both science and the environment.</p>
