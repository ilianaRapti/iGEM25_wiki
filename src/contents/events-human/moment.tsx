        <p>
           The <b>iGEM MOMENT</b> initiative aimed to bring iGEM teams from around the 
           world closer together by sharing the fun and creative side of their journeys. 
           Inspired by the Instagram concept “student moment”, we wanted to highlight 
           what life as an <b>iGEMer</b> looks like beyond the lab bench and competition stage.

            We reached out to teams across different countries and continents, 
            inviting them to send <b>photos and videos</b> that captured their team spirit, 
            daily routines, and memorable moments. The goal was to create a space where 
            teams could <b>see and celebrate each other’s experiences</b>, fostering a stronger 
            sense of global community.
            <br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br>

            This project was deeply tied to <b>inclusivity</b>. By sharing authentic, behind-the-scenes 
            glimpses from diverse teams, we showcased that iGEM is more than just a competition — 
            it’s a worldwide network of people working together, each with unique perspectives 
            and stories.

            The response was enthusiastic, with teams sending us vibrant, personal content. 
            By featuring this material on our social media platforms, we created a <b>virtual 
            meeting point</b> where science met humanity, showing that collaboration also means 
            fun, creativity, and shared identity.
            <br></br><br></br>

            Through iGEM MOMENT, we helped break down barriers and reminded participants that 
            no matter where they are, they are part of one <b>global synthetic biology family</b>.
