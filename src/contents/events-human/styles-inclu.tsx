        <p>
            Each week our <b>social media team</b> prepared five posts for <b>Instagram, Facebook</b> and <b>LinkedIn</b> - 
            one for each of the following columns -  that delivered short, understandable and engaging 
            lessons in biology. It is true that we live in a society where social media have a huge 
            impact on everyone and they can be highly useful in transmitting knowledge.

                The first series, <b>Biology in Everyday Life</b>, highlights the hidden ways biology 
                shapes our daily experiences. From the chemistry of tears to the reason we get 
                chills when listening to music, these posts uncover surprising facts that spark 
                curiosity. With pop culture references, nods to favorite TV shows and songs, and 
                colorful graphics, the series feels familiar and approachable, inviting audiences 
                to see biology as part of their own world.

            To explore the human body more deeply, we designed <b>Human Biology</b>, a three-slide journey 
            through each organ. The first slide offers a clear overview of the organ’s location and 
            function. The second slide adds personality with fun facts and a related movie quote. 
            The third slide goes molecular, featuring a biochemical pathway central to that organ’s 
            activity. By combining general knowledge, cultural touchpoints, and technical detail, 
            this series appeals both to newcomers and those eager to dive deeper.

                <b>Life’s Molecular Machine</b>: Life’s Molecular Machine is a weekly series that spotlights 
                fascinating molecules essential for life. Each post begins with a catchy intro, 
                followed by a playful fill-in-the-blank quiz that sneaks in key facts, and ends with 
                the molecule’s structure, a cautionary note on what happens if it malfunctions, and a 
                fun fact. It’s science made engaging as part of our digital science communication 
                perspective, blending creativity with biology to show how tiny molecular players have 
                a huge impact on our lives.

                    <b>Scientist of the Week</b> is an Instagram story series where three notable scientists 
                    are presented, and the audience is invited to guess who the featured scientist of 
                    the week is. After the guessing round, a follow-up story reveals the correct 
                    scientist and shares a few key details about their life, work, and scientific 
                    contributions.

                Our weekly scientific columns were designed with inclusivity at their core. By creating four recurring themes we 
                aimed to make science approachable for everyone, regardless of age, background, or prior knowledge. The posts 
                combined bright visuals, simple language, and clear explanations, ensuring that even complex biological concepts 
                became accessible and enjoyable. Posting on different platforms allowed us to reach out to different groups of people 
                (different age or academic backgrounds). Through this initiative, we created a space where people who might not 
                typically engage with science could feel welcomed, included, and inspired to learn more about the natural world.
