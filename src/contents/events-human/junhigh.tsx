        <p>
          Thirty junior-high students from the 6th General Junior
          High School of Ioannina were welcomed to the Department of
          Biological Applications and Technology for a full-day
          immersive experience in synthetic biology. The aim of
          this initiative was to <b>bridge the gap between young
            learners and the scientific community</b>, giving children
          the chance to experience science not as something distant or
          intimidating but as something they could <b>see, touch, and actively
            participate in</b>.

            Planning this event required close collaboration between our team,
            the local schools, and university staff. We designed the day to
            include a variety of activities, balancing educational content
            with fun, <b>hands-on experiences</b>.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Different learning styles</b>: We incorporated visual, tactile, and auditory elements to ensure all children could engage meaningfully.</li>
              <li><b>Safety</b>: Clear guidelines, protective gear, and supervision at every stage.</li>
              <li><b>Accessibility</b>: Simplified explanations, structured time slots, and multiple breaks to avoid cognitive overload.</li>
            </ul> <br></br>
            Our team also prepared LEGO-based demonstrations, two fully equipped
            laboratory rotations, and a closing awards ceremony to celebrate
            student creativity.

            The day began with a <b>warm welcome</b> and an introduction to synthetic
            biology as “designing with biology”. LEGO bricks helped visualize
            genes as building blocks. Students participated in storytelling and
            a <b>hands-on gene-transfection activity</b>, followed by an open Q&A.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Later, they worked in pairs to design <b>creative solutions</b> to real problems, supported by mentors to ensure equal involvement.
            <br></br><br></br>

            In the labs, they:
            <ul>
              <li>Created nitrogen smoke and dramatic foam eruptions in the Organic Chemistry Lab,</li>
              <li>Practiced basic microbiology techniques and observed bacteria for the first time.</li>
            </ul>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Every step was accompanied by safety briefings and simple explanations.
            <br></br>
            The day ended with an <b>awards ceremony</b>, where the top five projects received symbolic plane-tree candles.

            <br></br>
            By creating a safe, supportive environment, we broke down barriers and helped young learners see themselves as future contributors to science.
