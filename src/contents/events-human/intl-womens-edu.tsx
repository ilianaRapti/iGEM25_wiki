              <p>Education is not only about transmitting knowledge but also about fostering <b>critical reflection</b>. International Women’s Day offered an opportunity to highlight the role of women in STEM, while also revealing barriers they continue to face in educational and professional settings.</p>
              <p>Research shows persistent gender gaps: women remain underrepresented in STEM studies and careers (European Commission, She Figures 2021). UNESCO’s Cracking the Code (2017) emphasizes how stereotypes and limited role models affect girls’ and women’s educational choices. Our initiative sought to transform these global findings into <b>a local learning experience</b>, where our university community could reflect on its own values and realities.</p>

              <p><b>Activity 1: Questionnaire</b><br/>The survey asked about opportunities, career advancement, gender balance, and role models in academia. More than 500 students participated. Results highlighted both progress and ongoing challenges. For example, 70% of students reported noticing gender imbalance in their field, often attributing it to stereotypes—a finding consistent with the National Academies (2020) on underrepresentation in STEM education. Encouragingly, 88% identified female academic staff as role models, confirming the pedagogical importance of visibility (UNESCO, 2017).</p>
              <p><b>Activity 2: Cafeteria Stand</b><br/>Students answered the question: “What is the biggest challenge women face in science?” More than 70 responses highlighted stereotypes, patriarchal attitudes as well as lack of institutional support. The stand worked as a dialogic learning tool, creating space for peer learning and awareness, similar to practices suggested by UN Women (Gender Snapshot 2022) in promoting inclusive education.</p>
              <p><b>Activity 3: Video Interviews</b><br/>Filmed at Lake Ioannina, the interviews gave students a voice while encouraging others to listen. The video reached over 20,000 viewers, amplifying awareness far beyond the university. Freire’s educational theory suggests that dialogue is central to empowerment. So, this activity embodied that by making students co-creators of knowledge.</p>

              <p>Equally important, the project functioned as <b>education-in-action</b>: students were not only participants but also learners, critically reflecting on the cultural and institutional forces shaping their academic paths.</p>

              <p>Learning initiatives on gender equality address a gap often missing in formal curricula. By bringing real voices and data into the conversation, we transformed International Women’s Day from a symbolic celebration into a <b>teaching moment.</b></p>
              <p>Reports such as She Figures 2021 and UNESCO’s Cracking the Code stress the need for cultural change alongside policy reform. Our activities showed how universities can serve as laboratories for this change by using participatory methods to engage students directly.</p>

    We celebrated International Women’s Day with three educational activities:
    <ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>An anonymous survey.</li>
        <li>A cafeteria stand.</li>
        <li>Video interviews at Lake Ioannina.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
       Goal: learn how students see gender equality in science and turn their voices into a learning tool.

    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Education is not just teaching—it’s also reflection.</li>
      <li>Women in STEM still face barriers. She Figures 2021 shows they are underrepresented in higher roles. UNESCO (2017) shows stereotypes affect girls’ choices early.</li>
      <li>Our project gave students a chance to think, share, and learn together.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Organization</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We ran three actions:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Survey: to get broad data.</li>
        <li>Stand: to spark peer dialogue.</li>
        <li>Interviews: to share voices widely.</li>
      </ol>
      Each was different, but all focused on learning <b>through participation</b>.
    </ul>

    <p><b>Implementation</b></p>
    <ul>
      <b>Survey</b> → 500+ answers.
      <ul>
        <li>56%: women have equal opportunities.</li>
        <li>70%: gender imbalance exists.</li>
        <li>59%: stereotypes cause it (matches National Academies, 2020).</li>
        <li>88%: they had a female role model (matches UNESCO, 2017 on role models).</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Stand</b> → 70 responses.
      <ul>
        <li>Main challenges: stereotypes, patriarchy, lack of support.</li>
        <li>Worked as a learning space, just like UN Women (2022) recommends.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Interviews</b> → filmed at the lake.
      <ul>
        <li>Video reached 20,000+ views.</li>
        <li>Made dialogue visible and accessible to everyone.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Outcomes and Results</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data + stories.</li>
      <li>Progress but also barriers.</li>
      <li>Students learned through sharing, not just listening.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Why is this important?</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Education must also question stereotypes.</li>
      <li>Our project turned International Women’s Day into a <b>lesson in equality</b>.</li>
      <li>Reports like <i>She Figures 2021</i> show why this is urgent: representation is still unequal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>What did we gain?</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Knowledge about gender equality at our university.</li>
      <li>Real conversations.</li>
      <li>A wider reach than expected.</li>
      <li>Proof that <b>education + science + community = impact</b>.</li>
    </ul>
