              <p>As part of our project, our team created a <b>documentary dedicated to the plane trees of Greece</b>, highlighting both their cultural and social importance as well as the threat they face from the fungus Ceratocystis platani, which causes canker stain. Plane trees are not only long-living symbols of Greek tradition but also deeply connected with local identity, especially in Epirus and Ioannina. Our short film, PLÁTANOS (from the greek word Platanos – plane tree), aimed to give a voice to those who hold stories, knowledge and emotions about these trees, and to share these perspectives with a broad audience. As a part of our inclusive educational outreach, we brought together experts, locals, artists and researchers.</p>

              <p>To ensure inclusivity, we carefully designed the structure of the documentary. Our preparation involved selecting a wide range of interviewees—villagers, professors, agronomists, artists, and researchers—to cover every aspect of the issue. We also placed special importance on including elderly villagers, whose memories and traditions are often overlooked in modern discussions. In this way, we made sure that people from different backgrounds, with different levels of expertise, and different life experiences, all had the opportunity to express themselves. We prepared tailored questions for each speaker, ensuring their unique voices could be heard and respected. Lastly, we contacted a Greek artist, Ermis, to give us the rights to use some of his songs in our documentary. </p>

              <p>Filming took place in multiple settings to capture diverse perspectives. We recorded footage at the plane trees of Ioannina, in the villages of Syrrako and Vitsa, and through video calls/interviews with special guests. The locals shared personal stories, memories and feelings, while experts and village leaders explained the seriousness of the disease and its implications for society. An artist who created a statue inspired by a plane tree, as well as a graduate student who researched plane trees and Ceratocystis platani, also contributed their insights. The artist, Aphrodite Liti, said that she would love to share her view as another doctor - a doctor for the soul, as well as “I see that you are wonderful continuers of my work. You have taken over and I’d love to see you win the prize”. By including such a wide variety of voices, we highlighted the inclusivity of the project: no single perspective dominated, and everyone’s relationship with plane trees was given equal weight. Our own team members also appeared in the documentary, briefly presenting our project and offering a scientific solution as part of the narrative.</p>

To further extend its reach, we created short reels and clips for Instagram and TikTok, ensuring that younger generations—who may not traditionally engage with this issue—could also be informed and inspired. Through this approach, the voices of locals, experts and artists were amplified and shared beyond their communities. Inclusivity was achieved both in the creation of the documentary (by inviting different perspectives) and in its dissemination (by making it accessible and engaging for a wide and diverse audience).</p>

              <p>The action mattered because it connected science with people’s lived experiences. Too often, scientific problems are discussed only in academic circles, leaving behind the very communities affected by them. By including voices that are usually unheard—especially the elderly, villagers and artists—we emphasized that knowledge is not limited to scientific expertise, but also exists in memory, tradition, and culture. At the same time, the documentary allowed people who may never have heard of canker stain to learn about its devastating impact, bridging the gap between local experiences and global awareness. This inclusivity ensured that the cultural and emotional importance of plane trees was represented alongside their biological and ecological value.</p>

              <p>Through this action we learned how listening to and amplifying diverse voices can enrich our understanding and give depth to our project. The process showed us that science becomes stronger when combined with tradition, art, and personal experiences. It also gave us practical experience in interviewing, filming, and editing, as well as in using social media for effective outreach. Most importantly, it strengthened our bond as a team and reminded us that our work is not just about the lab—it is about people, their stories, and their connection to the world around them.</p>
