              <p>On September 25th, our team had the honor of visiting the <b>Special Education School of Ioannina</b>, where we spent the day with 70 wonderful students. Our goal was to design an action that was not only engaging but also <b>inclusive</b>—an action that gave equal opportunities for participation to students who are often overlooked in science communication activities.</p>

              <p>To ensure every student could be fully included, we carefully adapted our program. We prepared <b>simple, clear presentations, hands-on activities</b>, and a <b>fairytale</b> written by our team as a playful entry point to synthetic biology. With the valuable support of the educators at the school, we split the students into two groups—<b>junior high</b> and <b>high school</b>—so each class could receive attention adapted to their age and needs. </p>
              <p>Before our visit, we consulted the teacher of the Special School, who advised us to avoid hand-based activities so that all students could participate equally. She also suggested using simple movements in our music-and-motion game to ensure accessibility. Her guidance helped us make the activity inclusive for everyone.</p>

              <p>The activities were designed with <b>accessibility</b> in mind. We used a microphone so that students with hearing difficulties could follow along. We asked simple, open-ended questions to spark participation, and we offered multiple activity stations (clay creation, drawing, board game, and notebook writing) so that each student could engage in the way that suited them best. By giving them choices, we allowed their <b>creativity</b>, <b>curiosity</b>, and <b>voice</b> to <b>shine</b>. In the junior high session, we even incorporated a music and movement activity, encouraging students to “dance like fairies” and making learning joyful and inclusive.</p>
