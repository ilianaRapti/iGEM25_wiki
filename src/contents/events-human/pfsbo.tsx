              <p>On March 28–30, our team participated in the 3rd Panhellenic Student Conference of Bioscientists (PFSB) in Alexandroupolis. Two of our members gave a presentation introducing the iGEM competition, sharing our team’s achievements, and presenting this year’s project on plane tree disease. From the start, we designed the session with inclusivity in mind, ensuring that the content was approachable to all students, regardless of their academic background or prior knowledge of synthetic biology.</p>

              <p>The presentation unfolded in three parts:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Introduction to iGEM – We explained what iGEM is and how it opens opportunities for students worldwide to engage with synthetic biology. Emphasis was placed on the competition’s culture of collaboration and inclusivity, showing that science thrives when diverse perspectives are welcomed.</li>
                <li>
                  Our team’s journey – We shared stories from previous years, highlighting how students with different skills and backgrounds worked together to shape projects and grow as a team. </li>
                <li>
                  This year’s project – We introduced our 2025 project on Ceratocystis platani, the fungus threatening plane trees. Beyond the science, we highlighted why this problem matters to all communities, not just researchers, making it relevant and accessible to a wider audience.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To foster inclusivity and engagement, the session ended with a short quiz of three multiple-choice questions. 137 students could answer using their phones, ensuring that everyone could participate equally and without pressure. The quiz covered the origin, transmission, and symptoms of C. platani, turning complex knowledge into an approachable, collective learning moment. The quiz included the following questions:</p>

              <p>The talk successfully brought together students from across Greece, regardless of their prior exposure to synthetic biology. The quiz and open discussion created an environment where every participant felt they could contribute, ask questions, and share personal experiences with plane trees. In all three questions, most participants answered incorrectly at first, but by the end of the discussion they had understood the correct information. Many attendees opened up about their memories and concerns, reinforcing that science communication becomes stronger when it resonates with personal stories. </p>

      <p><b>Dates</b>
      <br></br>
      March 28–30, 2025
      </p>

      <p><b>What We Did</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduced iGEM</li>
        <li>Shared our team’s journey</li>
        <li>Presented this year’s plane tree disease project</li>
        <li>Designed the session to be inclusive & accessible</li>
        <li>Ended with a fun quiz → made learning interactive & engaging</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      On March 28–30, our team joined the PFSB in Alexandroupolis. Two of our members gave a talk that:

        <ul>
          <li>Explained what iGEM is and why it matters globally.</li>
          <li>Showed our team’s achievements and story.</li>
          <li>
            Introduced this year’s project on <i>Ceratocystis platani</i> (the fungus harming plane trees).
          </li>
        </ul>

        We made sure the whole session was designed with inclusivity in mind → approachable to students
        from <i>all backgrounds</i>, not just biology.


      
      <p><b>Organization</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Participation was arranged with the conference’s organizing committee. Together we shaped a
          session that felt:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Informative → clear slides, real examples.</li>
          <li>Accessible → simple language, no jargon.</li>
          <li>Interactive → quiz + open discussion.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <b>Goal:</b> break down barriers so every student could follow & join in.
      <p><b>Implementation</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The session had 3 parts:</b></li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Intro to iGEM</b> – Opportunities for students worldwide, teamwork, inclusivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Our journey</b> – Past projects + how diverse skills built our team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>This year’s project</b> – Plane tree disease explained in simple, relatable terms.
          </li>
        </ol>
  
        To wrap up, we added a short quiz (3 questions, via phone):
        <ul>
          <li>Origin of <i>C. platani</i></li>
          <li>Transmission</li>
          <li>Symptoms</li>
        </ul>
          This turned science into a shared learning moment where everyone could participate equally.
      </ul>

      <p><b>Outcome and Results</b></p>
      The activity brought together students from all over Greece.
      <br></br>
      <b>What worked well:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Students felt comfortable asking questions.</li>
        <li>Open discussion sparked memories & concerns about plane trees.</li>
        <li>
          Many attendees shared personal stories → showing how science connects with everyday life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      The quiz was a highlight → fun, interactive, and inclusive.
      <p><b>Why It Is Important</b></p>
      This activity mattered because it showed how outreach can be inclusive and educational at once:
      <ul>
        <li>Made synthetic biology accessible with simple explanations.</li>
        <li>Put students with different expertise on equal terms.</li>
        <li>
          Created a shared space where facts + personal stories enriched the discussion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p><b>What We Gained</b><br></br>
      Through this activity, we:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learned that inclusivity = higher engagement.</li>
        <li>
          Saw how interactive tools (like quizzes) bring everyone into the conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Connected with students not just as scientists, but as people with diverse perspectives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strengthened our belief that science communication is for everyone, not just experts.
        </li>
