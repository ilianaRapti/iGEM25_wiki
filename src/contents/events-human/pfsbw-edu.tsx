              <p>As part of our commitment to combining scientific expertise with practical applications, our team at iGEM Ioannina designed and delivered a hands-on workshop on AlphaFold and PyMOL during the 3rd Panhellenic Student Conference of Bioscientists. The aim was to familiarize attendees with two cutting-edge tools widely used in structural biology and computational modeling.</p>
              <p>The primary goal of this initiative was to bridge the gap between theory and practice by introducing undergraduate and postgraduate students to modern computational tools in structural biology. By combining conceptual explanations with hands-on exercises, we sought to provide an engaging and meaningful learning experience for learners with different levels of prior knowledge.</p>
              <p> Through the workshop, participants were encouraged to explore the practical applications of AlphaFold and PyMOL in research, gain confidence in using computational tools, and understand how these technologies can enhance scientific inquiry.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Empower participants: Help students integrate AlphaFold and PyMOL into their own research.</li>
                <li>Structured learning: Provide a clear and accessible educational pathway.</li>
                <li>Skill development: Cultivate both practical bioinformatics skills and conceptual understanding.</li>

              <p>Our primary pedagogical goal was to help bioscience students integrate structural-biology tools into their research by combining conceptual framing with practical, guided exercises. Parallel to that, we set clear inclusivity goals:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>make learning accessible across varied backgrounds and learning styles,</li>
                <li>provide multiple content formats (visual, textual, auditory), and</li>
                <li>allow flexible pacing and accommodations (extended time, step-by-step guides, and contact points for support).</li>
                <li>This dual focus (education + inclusivity) guided every design decision for the workshop.</li>

                        <p>To ensure a well-structured and impactful workshop, we began by consulting <b>Professor Charalambos Stamatis and Dr. Vasiliki-Michaela Patila</b>. They approved the initiative and provided guidance on designing a progressive learning curve, incorporating interactive elements and focusing on biological insights rather than the algorithmic complexity behind AlphaFold.</p>
                        <p>We then developed a detailed plan outlining the educational goals, the core tools to be presented, and a methodology to ensure an inclusive experience for both novice and experienced participants. When a new version of AlphaFold was released with a different interface, we consulted Dr. Patila again, ensuring the original educational objectives remained intact.</p>
                        <p>To prepare participants, we created and distributed comprehensive materials, including installation guides, step-by-step tutorial videos, and ready-to-use datasets. A week before the main event, we ran a mock session in Ioannina with our team, which allowed us to identify unclear sections, refine our explanations, and practice coordination as instructors.</p>

                          <li><b>Expert guidance & planning</b>: Structured the workshop based on feedback and created an inclusive learning plan.</li>
                          <li><b>Adaptation & preparation</b>: Updated content for the new AlphaFold version and provided preparatory materials.</li>
