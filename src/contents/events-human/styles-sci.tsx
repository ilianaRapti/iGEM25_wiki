            <b>Biology in Everyday Life</b>: This column includes fun biological facts, 
            from the variety of the chemistry of tears to why we get chills when 
            listening to music. Adding elements such as references to tv shows, 
            music and pretty graphics made the posts more likeable and friendly 
            to social media users, by catching their attention.

                <b>Life’s Molecular Machine</b>: Life’s Molecular Machine is a weekly series that 
                spotlights fascinating molecules essential for life. Each post begins with a 
                catchy intro, followed by a playful fill-in-the-blank quiz that sneaks in key 
                facts, and ends with the molecule’s structure, a cautionary note on what happens 
                if it malfunctions, and a fun fact. It’s science made engaging to a wider audience, 
                blending educational creativity with biology to show how tiny molecular players 
                have a huge impact on our lives.

                <b>Scientist of the Week</b> is an Instagram story series where three 
                notable scientists are presented, and the audience is invited to 
                guess who the featured scientist of the week is. After the guessing round, 
                a follow-up story reveals the correct scientist and shares a few key details 
                about their life, work, and scientific contributions.

                By presenting <b>scientific facts</b> in a structured, consistent, and visually appealing 
                way, we offered our audience the chance to learn continuously, in <b>small steps</b>. The 
                recurring themes helped build familiarity, while the small-sized content provided an 
                easy entry point to biological concepts, as we live in a society where much knowledge can 
                be gained from social media. In this way, we fostered curiosity, supported informal learning, and promoted science literacy among a broad and diverse audience.
