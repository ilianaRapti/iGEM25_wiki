                Engaging with organizations outside of academia is essential for effective science 
                communication. With this in mind, we reached out to <a target="_blank" href="https://we4all.com/gr/">We4All</a>, a Greek non-profit 
                organisation dedicated to environmental protection, reforestation and public education. 
                Their mission, “To help Earth heal and remind people this planet is our home,” closely 
                aligned with the goals of our iGEM project, which focuses on protecting the environment 
                through synthetic biology.

            We arranged a <b>video call</b> with the CEO of We4All to open a dialogue between our team and their 
            organization. During the meeting, the CEO described how We4All operates — from tree planting 
            initiatives to environmental education programs and collaboration with local communities. This 
            gave us <b>valuable insight into the real-world challenges of environmental action and public 
            engagement</b>.

            After listening to their experiences, we presented our project and outreach activities, 
            explaining how synthetic biology can play a role in environmental protection. The CEO was 
            highly engaged, asking detailed questions about our research methods and project design. 
            His interest showed us that our work resonates beyond the laboratory, reaching individuals 
            working directly on environmental issues.

            This interaction was a strong example of <b>how science communication bridges the gap between 
            researchers and society</b>. By connecting with We4All, we demonstrated that science does not 
            exist in isolation. When researchers and NGOs share knowledge, they can educate, inspire and 
            empower communities to work together for environmental sustainability.
