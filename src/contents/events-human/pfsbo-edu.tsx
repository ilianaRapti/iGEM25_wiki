              <p>The presentation was structured in <b>three main parts:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Introduction to iGEM</b> – We explained what iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is, how it provides a platform for students worldwide to design and implement synthetic biology projects, and the skills participants gain in research, teamwork, and science communication.</li>
                <li><b>Our team’s journey</b> – We presented the history of our team’s participation in iGEM, highlighting key milestones and achievements from previous years. This section emphasized the evolution of our work, the challenges we overcame, and how each year contributed to building a stronger foundation for our current projects.</li>
                <li><b>This year’s project</b> – We introduced our 2025 project, which focuses on addressing the serious disease threatening plane trees (Platanus spp.). The presentation covered:</li>
                <li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The biology of Ceratocystis platani, the fungal pathogen causing canker stain disease.</li>

In all three questions, most participants answered incorrectly at first, but by the end of the discussion they had understood the correct information.</p>
              <p>Beyond raising awareness, <b>the talk opened a dialogue with participants</b>, many of whom expressed personal connections to plane trees.
