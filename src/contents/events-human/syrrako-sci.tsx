                On August 7th, our team traveled to Syrrako, a traditional mountain village close to Ioannina, to present our project to the local community. The choice of Syrrako was symbolic: in 2012, the village lost its two iconic, centuries-old plane trees that had stood in the main square for over 800 years. Their replacement with small hybrid trees, while necessary, left the community with a deep sense of loss. This provided us with a meaningful opportunity to communicate, as well as connect our project with a real-world, emotionally significant issue for the local population.

            First of all, we contacted the president of Syrrako, Giorgos Vaitsis, and planned our visit carefully through several team meetings. Our objective was to present the problem in a clear and understandable way, explain our project’s methodology, and listen to the perspectives of the community. Alongside our scientific presentation, we brought complementary educational materials, such as our fairytale, activity book and a puzzle inspired by the story, ensuring we had tools to engage with younger audiences.

            As soon as we arrived, the president of the village gave us a tour of the village and introduced us to its history and traditions. We then carried out our presentation at the Conference Center of Syrrako to a diverse audience. Alongside the scientific talk, our fairytale and activity materials provided an alternative way for young children to engage with the topic. The presentation was followed by an open discussion, allowing us to hear their side of the problem as well. Leaving the conference center, we interacted with the villagers at the local shops and cafeterias and they were very open to sharing their more personal stories and memories of the plane trees and their role in their lives. All this storytelling was filmed and added in a short documentary that we published at our YouTube channel. Its purpose was to share their voices and stories to a much more broad audience in order to express the importance of nature and plane trees in their lives.

            Locals shared their personal experiences and memories of the two plane trees that once stood in the square. They expressed grief for their loss, describing the trees as daily companions and central to their festivals and cultural identity. Some of their words were: “I never expected that the plane trees would die before me”, “The day we removed the plane trees was like a funeral”, “It was a part of our daily lives. I don’t think anyone could imagine that this point of reference would cease to exist”. The agronomist provided us with constructive feedback on our approach, stating that our treatment could have saved the plane trees of Syrrako, while the villagers asked thoughtful questions about the potential of our treatment. Children participated actively in the creative activities, showing that they, too, could grasp the importance of the issue.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            By linking our scientific work to the loss of Syrrako’s plane trees, we demonstrated that synthetic biology has real-world and human-centered applications. The visit also bridged the gap between scientists and society, creating an open platform for knowledge exchange between experts, villagers and students alike. Lastly, seeing in reality the importance of our work and the need of the villagers to save their trees was definitely a highlight of our work.
