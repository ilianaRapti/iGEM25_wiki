      {/* Introduction section */}
        <p>
            On 19 May 2025, we joined departmental leadership for a <b>live interview</b> on the municipal radio 
            programme <b>“Polychroma Synaisthimata” </b>(“Colorful Feelings” in Greek), hosted by Giota Florou. 
            The conversation introduced iGEM and the team’s medal-winning journey (2021 → bronze, 2023 → silver, 
            2024 → gold + nominations) and highlighted two projects:
            <ul>
                <li><b>ATROPOS (2024)</b> – a conceptual therapeutic for West Nile virus–related encephalitis.</li>
                <li><b>2025 project</b> – a CRISPR–Cas13D strategy to protect plane trees (Platanus spp.) from the fungal pathogen C. platani.</li>
            </ul>
            Beyond public outreach, the interview focused on <b>making synthetic biology accessible to 
            everyone</b>, demonstrating that local culture and community values can connect diverse audiences 
            to cutting-edge science.
            <br></br><br></br>

            Inclusivity in science means more than inviting participation. It means <b>designing communication so that everyone can understand and contribute</b>. The radio programme offered a platform to:
            <ol>
                
                <li><b>Explain iGEM</b> in plain language for listeners of all ages and educational backgrounds.</li>
                <li>Present projects with <b>local cultural relevance</b>, ensuring the topic resonates beyond the scientific community.</li>
                <li>Model <b>transparent dialogue</b> on biosafety, funding, and ethics, building trust with the wider public</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
