              <p>In 2025, the University of Ioannina iGEM team brought its plane-tree conservation project into national media (ERT News, Alfavita.gr, In.gr, Dr. Vasiliki Michopoulou, Journalist-Science Writer, BS Biology, MA Political Sciences & International Relations, PhD International Relations, Municipality of Ioannina - Mayor of Ioannina). All pieces were produced with the team’s full agreement, guidance and scientific input. Beyond accuracy, the team deliberately shaped these outputs to be inclusive: articles were paired with accessible formats (short plain-language summaries, captions/transcripts for audio/video, and easy-read variants) and outreach activities that lowered barriers for diverse audiences.</p>
              <p>Effective science communication is only valuable when everyone can access it. For the 2025 campaign, accessibility and inclusivity were treated as design priorities, not add-ons. The team set <b>three aims</b>: to <b>explain</b> complex synthetic-biology concepts in plain language, to <b>publish</b> materials in multiple formats, and to <b>involve</b> diverse stakeholders such as schools, senior groups, people with disabilities, and neurodivergent community members in co-creation and feedback.</p>

              <p>The campaign worked closely with media outlets and community partners to embed accessibility into every output. Each piece was designed to meet standards for clarity, usability, and inclusivity. This included producing plain-language and easy-read resources alongside full articles, ensuring translations between Greek and English, and offering a direct contact point for accessibility requests.</p>

                <li><b>Alfavita.gr:</b> The article included a one-page easy-read version with icons, large fonts, and alt-text images. Editors added a short Greek-to-English summary for broader reach.</li>
                <li><b>In.gr:</b> A long feature was paired with a bullet-point summary, a downloadable FAQ on safety and scope, and regional notes, plus an accessibility contact.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Across all outlets, the team supplied transcripts, captions, plain-language abstracts, easy-read PDFs, translations, and WCAG-aware design suggestions.</p>

              <p>The campaign achieved a broader reach, with materials shared through schools, community groups, and local networks. New audiences engaged directly, with requests for tailored sessions and resources coming from elder care centres and disability organisations. <b>Accessibility</b> was measured through downloads of easy-read PDFs, transcript use, caption views, and format requests. User testing with neurodivergent participants and people with low digital literacy led to improvements such as clearer headings, bullet summaries, and pauseable media. The inclusive framing also secured regional support and opened new channels with municipal authorities and conservation partners.</p>

              <p>Making resources available in multiple formats ensured equitable access and participation in science discussions. This strengthened democratic involvement in decision-making. Transparent communication, including FAQs, transcripts, and clear contact points, built trust and reduced misunderstandings. Co-creation with diverse users improved clarity and usability, demonstrating that better outreach also leads to better science.</p>
              <p>The team also created an inclusivity checklist and rapid-adapt templates, offering a scalable model that others can adopt.</p>
