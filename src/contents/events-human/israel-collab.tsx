            <p>
            <b>On August 28, 2025,</b> iGEM Ioannina participated in an <b>international 
            online meet-up organized by iGEM TAU (Tel Aviv University, Israel)</b>. 
            The gathering brought together <b>twelve teams from around the world</b>, 
            creating a shared space for collaboration, knowledge exchange, and 
            networking ahead of the Grand Jamboree.
            <br></br><br></br>

            The event began with a warm round of introductions, where each team 
            presented its university, focus area, and unique skills. This icebreaker 
            immediately helped participants identify common ground and fostered an 
            atmosphere of openness and cooperation.
            <br></br><br></br>

            A keynote presentation by the principal investigator of iGEM TAU followed, 
            introducing the concept of toehold switches, a cutting-edge RNA regulatory 
            technology with applications in diagnostics and biosensing. This talk inspired 
            multiple teams to consider new ways of integrating this technology into their 
            own projects, laying the groundwork for potential collaborations.
            <br></br>

            Each of the twelve teams then delivered a brief presentation 
            about their 2025 projects. The format encouraged peer-to-peer learning, 
            with live Q&A sessions and evaluation forms that provided constructive 
            feedback on clarity, visual design, and scientific creativity.

                <b>Representing iGEM Ioannina, two team members presented our project, 
                “Amadryads”</b>, which focuses on protecting plane trees (<i>Platanus spp</i>.) 
                from the deadly fungal pathogen <i>Ceratocystis platani</i>.
                <br></br>

                Our talk highlighted:
                <ul>
                    <li>The ecological urgency of addressing canker-stain disease across Europe,</li>
                    <li>The use of CRISPR-Cas13d to target fungal RNA,</li>
                    <li>The integration of a toehold riboswitch for dual safety and specificity,</li>
                    <li>The application of chitosan nanoparticles for sustainable, non-viral delivery methods.</li>
                </ul>
                By emphasizing open-source design, adaptability of our bioinformatics 
                pipeline, and our willingness to share protocols, <b>we invited other 
                teams to collaborate on guide-RNA design, delivery techniques, and 
                Human Practices initiatives</b>.

                    At the conclusion of the session, participants voted 
                    on all presentations. <b>iGEM Ioannina received the highest 
                    overall score, earning the Best Presentation Award for 
                    both scientific quality and effective communication</b>.
                    <br></br>

                    More importantly, the event planted the seeds for 
                    future collaborations, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sharing bioinformatics pipelines for CRISPR guide design with teams interested in RNA-targeting strategies,</li>
                        <li>Planning joint Human Practices workshops focused on biosafety and ethics,</li>
                        <li>Exploring the adaptation of toehold switch technology for plant-pathogen detection alongside iGEM TAU and others,</li>
                        <li>Exchanging nanoparticle delivery protocols to refine sustainable non-viral systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This meet-up demonstrated the <b>transformative power of virtual 
                    collaboration</b>. By connecting teams across borders and time zones, 
                    it fostered rapid knowledge exchange, peer mentorship, and a 
                    sense of collective purpose. Winning the Best Presentation 
                    Award <b>validated our ability to communicate complex science 
                    clearly, a crucial foundation for any successful collaboration
                    moving forward</b>.
