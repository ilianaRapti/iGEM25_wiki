              <p>On June 18th, our team participated in “Women in History Afternoon Tea,” an event organized by The English Workshop at Epirus Palace Hotel in Ioannina. Designed to highlight women’s contributions across history, the event created an educational space where children could learn about female role models. For our team, this was an opportunity to enrich the event with a science-focused perspective, showing how education and inclusivity are deeply connected.</p>

              <p>The school structured the event as an interactive learning experience: each student researched a historical woman, embodied her through costume, and prepared both a presentation and a theatrical sketch. Our team was invited to expand the learning process by adding a contemporary scientific angle. Specifically, we were tasked with:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Introducing iGEM and explaining its collaborative educational model.</li>
                <li>Presenting our project in a way that children could understand and relate to.</li>
                <li>Sharing the findings of our survey conducted during the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.</li>

            <div className="content-span text_color_light">
              <p>During our contribution, we explained what iGEM is and how it functions as a student-driven educational platform. We introduced our current project in a simple way, accessible terms suitable for younger learners, ensuring the concepts remained understandable while still engaging. Later, we presented iGEM IOANNINA 2024 Project and Jamboree experience. Finally, we presented the results of our inclusivity survey, which led to lively discussions among the children, parents, and teachers. Their thoughtful questions showed that the session succeeded in creating a meaningful educational exchange.</p>

              <p>Educational opportunities like this ensure that inclusivity becomes part of learning at an early age. By combining history with contemporary science, children gained a broader understanding of equality and empowerment. Girls saw that they, too, can be scientists and innovators, while boys learned the importance of valuing diversity and fairness. This reinforced the idea that education is not just about knowledge transfer but also about shaping future values.</p>
